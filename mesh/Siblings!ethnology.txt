Parents' report of child's response to sibling's death in a neonatal or pediatric intensive care unit.	Research on sibling death in a pediatric/neonatal intensive care unit is limited, despite many qualitative differences from deaths at home or in hospitals' general care areas and has overlooked cultural differences.
Sibling influence on mexican-origin adolescents' deviant and sexual risk behaviors: the role of sibling modeling.	A growing body of research indicates that siblings uniquely influence each other's health risk behaviors during adolescence and young adulthood. Mechanisms underlying these associations, however, are largely unknown because they are rarely tested directly. The present study addressed this gap by examining the role of sibling modeling in explaining changes in Mexican-origin youths' deviant and sexual risk behaviors over time.
