Failure analysis of the fractured wires in sternal perichronal loops.	We report failure analysis of sternal wires in two cases in which a perichronal fixation technique was used to close the sternotomy. Various characteristics of the retrieved wires were compared to those of unused wires of the same grade and same manufacturer and with surgical wire specifications. In both cases, wire fracture was un-branched and transgranular and proceeded by a high cycle fatigue process, apparently in the absence of corrosion. However, stress anlysis indicates that the effective stress produced during strong coughing is lower than the yield strength. Our findings suggest that in order to reduce the risk for sternal dehiscence, the diameter of the wire used should be increased.
Hardware preservation after sternal wound infection in a lung transplant recipient.	Sternal wound infections can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Managing these complications is particularly challenging when infected hardware is involved. Traditional thinking mandates removal of infected hardware, yet this hardware is often essential to chest wall stability in the early postoperative period. Here, we present a case of an infected transverse sternotomy wound involving hardware in a lung transplant patient whose treatment included successful hardware preservation. Our experience and other experiences reported in the literature highlight the alternatives in the management of this complication.
