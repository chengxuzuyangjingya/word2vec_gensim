Talampicillin in the treatment and prophylaxis of urinary tract infection in children.	9 children presenting with an ampicillin-sensitive coliform urinary tract infection were treated with talampicillin using 1 week of full-dose treatment followed by low-dose prophylaxis. The bowel coliforms were ampicillin-resistant at the start in one girl and became resistant in the remaining 8 within 4 months. During a total of 44 months of talampicillin therapy, 6 girls (2 with vesico-ureteric reflux) developed a symptomatic re-infection of the urinary tract, a recurrence rate of 1 per 7.3 months, or 1.6 recurrences per annum. A further 12 girls were given prophylactic talampicillin, 9 after an initial therapeutic course of co-trimoxazole for 1 week and 3 following a period of prophylaxis with low-dose co-trimoxazole. The rectal swab from one girl showed partial ampicillin resistance but 9 of the remaining 11 showed that a predominance of ampicillin-resistance coliforms had emerged in the bowel flora within 4 months. 5 of the 12 also developed a symptomatic ampicillin-resistant urinary infection within 4 months, a recurrence rate of 1 per 7.1 months or 1.7 recurrences per annum. Talampicillin, though very effective in treating urinary infection, is not recommended for the prevention of subsequent recurrence.
Treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea in women with talampicillin in a single oral 1.5 g dose.	Four hundred and sixty women with uncomplicated gonorrhea were treated with a single oral dose of 1.5 g talampicillin. The success rate among those who attended for at least one follow-up examination after treatment was 99.14%. The antibiotic was well tolerated and no side effects were reported. Talampicillin given under supervision has proved to be the most effective and safest treatment in this area. A smaller dosage of talampicillin than ampicillin is required, the drug is better tolerated by the patient, and the time of nursing staff is saved.
