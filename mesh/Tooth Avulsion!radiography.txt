Autogenous tooth transplants for the pediatric dental patient: report of three cases.	There are select instances where autogenous tooth transplantation should be considered as part of the overall management of the developing occlusion in the child patient. These circumstances occur when there are missing mandibular premolars in Class II malocclusions with good faces, unevenly distributed agenesis, missing or lost incisors, and ectopic teeth. The purposes of this paper were to educate pediatric dentists about the autogenous tooth transplantation technique, its success, its potential advantages and disadvantages and to report on three cases treated with autogenesis tooth transplantation.
