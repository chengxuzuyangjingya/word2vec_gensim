Rotator cuff tendon ultrastructure assessment with reduced-orientation dipolar anisotropy fiber imaging.	The anisotropic fibrous structure of collagen can significantly affect MRI signal intensity. Use of this magic angle effect as a contrast mechanism has been previously termed "dipolar anisotropy fiber imaging." The goal of this pilot study was to use a reduced-orientation version of dipolar anisotropy fiber imaging to study rotator cuff tendon internal fiber structure.
