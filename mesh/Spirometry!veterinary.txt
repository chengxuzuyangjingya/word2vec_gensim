Evaluation of accuracy and reliability of indirect calorimetry for the measurement of resting energy expenditure in healthy dogs.	To assess accuracy and reliability of open-flow indirect calorimetry in dogs.
Age effects on blood gas, spirometry, airway reactivity, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology in clinically healthy horses.	Despite the increasing number of geriatric horses attended by veterinarians, there is a lack of understanding of aging-related changes on the respiratory system of horses.
Evaluation of flow-volume curves generated by forced-expiratory spirometry in anesthetized dogs.	Positive-pressure plethysmography was used to generate partial and maximal flow-volume data in 10 anesthetized dogs. Acetylcholine (ACh) administered IV induced significant (P less than 0.05) changes in tidal breathing, as evidenced by decreased tidal volume, increased respiratory rate and dynamic resistance, and decreased dynamic compliance. Partial forced-expiratory spirometry-determined from end inspiratory capacity and functional residual capacity, revealed changes in flow and volume as a result of ACh treatment. These changes were not seen in maximal curves (determined from total lung capacity). Peak expiratory flows were limited by the presence of an endotracheal tube. Use of instantaneous time-constant variables to evaluate the concavity or convexity of the downslope of a flow-volume curve did not reveal differences after IV ACh administration. Seemingly, partial forced-expiratory spirometry was useful in detecting bronchoconstriction in anesthetized dogs. Accepted techniques of flow-volume curve analysis for the evaluation of small airway function were not sensitive enough to detect bronchoconstriction in the dog.
