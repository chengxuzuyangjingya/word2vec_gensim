Facial cleft detected: is the palate normal?	Despite advances in ultrasound technology, the sensitivity for detection of facial clefts at the routine mid-trimester details scan remains relatively poor. This can be improved by the use of a three-point ultrasound screening protocol, although this is not routine in many countries. When a facial cleft is suspected at the routine scan, further imaging is usually required to detail the extent of the cleft and presence or absence of any other abnormalities. Involvement of the fetal palate is an important finding that will determine the requirement for surgery, audiology, and orthodontic services well into teenage years. There remains little uniformity in how a facial cleft is described antenatally, with involvement of the alveolar ridge frequently and incorrectly taken to mean involvement of the palate. Further, midline clefts of the hard and soft palates, where the fetal lips and alveolar ridge are intact, are a feature of many genetic conditions, but are almost never diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. In this chapter, we detail issues surrounding the nomenclature of facial clefts in relation to the palate, and describe some of the more commonly used two-dimensional and three-dimensional methodologies for imaging the fetal palate.
