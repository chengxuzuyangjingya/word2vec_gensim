Evaluation of a plaque assay for the maedi-progressive pneumonia-visna viruses.	A simple and direct plaque assay for maedi virus, two strains of progressive pneumonia virus, and two strains of visna virus has been developed and evaluated. The technique allows the plaques formed by these viruses to be localized without disturbing the host-cell substrate of sheep choroid plexus cells or the gelled maintenance medium over the host-cell monolayer. Diethylaminoethyl-dextran supplementation of the medium used to overlay strain K796 visna virus-infected cultures decreases the time required for maximum plaque development from 12 to 10 days, enhances the contrast of the plaques, increases the titer of plaque-forming units, and permits a plaque size heterogeneity to be realized. Both large and small plaques occur in cultures infected with the visna viruses, one strain of progressive pneumonia virus, or maedi virus. In contrast, the plaques observed in cultures infected with the second strain of progressive pneumonia virus are relatively homogeneous in size.
Ovine cells: their long-term cultivation and susceptibility to visna virus.	Sheep choroid plexus (SCP) cells have been subcultured more than 120 times and have undergone over 300 cell generations. These fibroblastic-appearing SCP II-B cells contain ovine-specific antigens, have an absolute plating efficiency of 23 to 28% and are as susceptible to visna virus infection and virus-induced cytopathology as their low passage level counterparts. Cultures of low, relatively high and high passage level SCP cells produced equivalent amounts of visna virus at similar rates when infected with equal amounts of visna virus. The passage level of the SCP II-B cells, their elapsed number of cell generations, their possession of ovine-specific antigens and their full susceptibility to visna virus allow these cells to be considered an established line of sheep cells.
