Early experience with robot-assisted surgery for mediastinal masses.	We report the experience of a single institution with the minimally invasive resection of mediastinal masses using the da Vinci robotic surgical system.
A method to facilitate subxiphoid pericardiotomy.	Pericardial effusion can be treated effectively by the technique of subxiphoid pericardial window. We present a case in which the Cooper retractor designed for transcervical thymectomy facilitated this operation. When available, the Cooper retractor can be useful in selected patients.
