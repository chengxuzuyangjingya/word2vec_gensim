Long-term impact of damage control laparotomy: a prospective study.	Damage control laparotomy (DCL) has beneficial effects on the long-term morbidity and survival of trauma patients.
Open repair of blunt thoracic aortic injury remains relevant in the endovascular era.	Thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) has been a major advance in the treatment of blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI), although many patients still undergo open repair. This study was undertaken to evaluate outcomes with open repair and TEVAR for BTAI.
Long-term follow-up and amputation-free survival in 497 casualties with combat-related vascular injuries and damage-control resuscitation.	The effectiveness of damage-control resuscitation (DCR) has been demonstrated in recent US conflicts. Wartime casualties treated for hemorrhagic shock from vascular wounds were studied to report the 24-hour transfusion requirements, graft patency, and amputation-free survival for major vascular injuries.
