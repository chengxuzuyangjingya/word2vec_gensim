Fritz de Quervain, MD (1868-1940): stenosing tendovaginitis at the radial styloid process.	Fritz de Quervain was the first surgeon to describe and treat chronic stenosing tendovaginitis at the radial styloid process. The current management of this condition differs little from his initial description and as a result the condition now bears his name. He and his mentor, Nobel Prize winner Theodor Kocher, advanced the understanding and treatment of thyroid disease, especially subacute nonsuppurative thyroiditis, another condition to which his name is attached. He was a pioneer of surgical technology and author of books and articles read worldwide and is largely responsible for the introduction of iodized table salt.
