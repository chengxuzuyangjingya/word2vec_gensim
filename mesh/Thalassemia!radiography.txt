"Step-off" vertebral body: Gaucher's disease versus sickle cell hemoglobinopathy.	Two patients with Gaucher's disease and radiographic findings in the spine similar to sickle cell hemoglobinopathy are reported, making a total of four known patients with Gaucher's disease who have these steplike vertebral endplate deformities. Serial films of a patient having Gaucher's disease compared with patients having sickle cell hemoglobinopathy suggest that different events lead to formation of the vertebral deformities. In Gaucher's disease, there is an initial collapse of the entire vertebral body with subsequent growth recovery peripherally. In sickle cell hemoglobinopathy, the endplate deformity is nontraumatic and is caused by an underlying growth arrest.
