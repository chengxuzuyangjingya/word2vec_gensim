Parasympathomimetic effects of mono sodium glutamate.	The effects of Mono sodium glutamate on smooth muscles were studied using the guinea-pig isolated ileum. Mono sodium glutamate produced spasmogenic effect. Atropine blocked the contractile response elicited by Mono sodium glutamate whereas mepyramine and hexamethonium failed to do so. These findings suggest a cholinergic involvement at post ganglionic site of action.
