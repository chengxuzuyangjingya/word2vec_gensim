Miracle fruit improves sweetness of a low-calorie dessert without promoting subsequent energy compensation.	This study sought to determine if miracle fruit enhances sweetness and acceptability of a sour, low-sugar dessert, and reduces energy intake. Subjects (n=13) completed four trials in a randomized cross over design. Subjects ate standardized breakfast and lunch. Lunch was followed by lemon juice based popsicles that were either normal, sucrose sweetened (854J) popsicles (REG) or a sour, low-sugar (142J) version (DIET) with or without miracle fruit administration preceding consumption. Energy consumption for the remainder of the day was measured by weighed food intake. Popsicles were evaluated for acceptability using a 9-point hedonic scale; sweetness and fullness were assessed by visual analog scales. Subjects rated DIET as sweeter when consumed after miracle fruit (58 ± 36 mm vs. 29 ± 38 mm); however, there was no difference in hedonic preference. Subjects did not detect a difference in sweetness for REG compared to DIET with miracle fruit. Consumption of DIET with miracle fruit produced lower energy intake compared to REG with (-1017 ± 1022J) and without (-955 ± 1302J) miracle fruit. Thus, miracle fruit can enhance the sweetness of a low sugar dessert while limiting energy intake in comparison to a higher calorie, sucrose-sweetened popsicles.
