Sexaully motivated burglaries.	Overt or covert sexual motivation was found in several repetitive, compulsive burglars. Voyeuristic impulses, transvetism, confused sexual identity, and hatred of mother transferred to women in general are common findings. The possibility of eventual serious attacks on women should be considered in those who in addition to burglaries, particularly committed in bizarre circumstances and alone, have a history of minor attacks on women and mistreatment of animals. The cat appears to symbolize a woman, so mistreatment of cats in combination with sexually motivated burglaries should be considered an important prognostic sign.
