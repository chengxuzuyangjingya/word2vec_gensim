Complete genome sequence of Vibrio vulnificus bacteriophage SSP002.	Vibrio vulnificus phages are abundant in coastal marine environments, shellfish, clams, and oysters. SSP002, a V. vulnificus-specific bacteriophage, was isolated from oysters from the west coast of South Korea. In this study, the complete genome of SSP002 was sequenced and analyzed for the first time among the V. vulnificus-specific bacteriophages.
