Dose-dependent effects of angiotensin II, acetylcholine and vasopressin on the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ in suspension primary cultures of zona fasciculata/reticularis cells from bovine adrenal cortex.	The effects of angiotensin II (AII), acetylcholine and vasopressin on the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ have been little studied in adrenocortical cells from the zona fasciculata/reticularis (ZFR). Primary cultures of bovine ZFR cells maintained in suspension cultured for 72 h produce cortisol in response to AII (0.1 microM), acetylcholine (0.1 mM) and vasopressin (1 microM). This response is accompanied by a breakdown of membrane phosphoinositides from [3H]inositol-prelabelled cells. Using cells loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura-2, the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ was measured in response to increasing doses of all three agonists and found to increase in a graded fashion in each case. The basal intracellular concentration of Ca2+ was 75 +/- 3 nM (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 52), rising to a maximum 1.82 +/- 0.14-fold (n = 6) for AII (0.1 microM), 1.35 +/- 0.05-fold (n = 7) for acetylcholine (0.1 mM) and 1.27 +/- 0.10-fold (n = 6) for vasopressin (1 microM). In the case of AII and acetylcholine, agonists were added sequentially in medium of normal extracellular Ca2+ concentration (1.2 mM) or in medium in which the Ca2+ concentration was buffered to approximate to the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ (75-100 nM). Evidence was thereby obtained that both AII and acetylcholine mobilize a common intracellular pool of Ca2+. Our findings suggest that these three agonists, all of which stimulate phospholipase C, increase intracellular Ca2+ through a mechanism which depends, at least in part, on the release of Ca2+ from a common intracellular pool.
The M3 muscarinic receptor mediates acetylcholine-induced cortisol secretion from bovine adrenocortical zona fasciculata/reticularis cells.	In order to characterize the receptor subtype mediating acetylcholine (ACh)-induced cortisol secretion from purified bovine adrenocortical zona fasciculata/reticularis cells in primary culture, the potencies of a range of selective muscarinic antagonists of ACh-induced steroidogenesis were assessed by Schild analysis. Basal secretion of cortisol was 10.2 +/- 1.4 pmol/well/30 min. ACh stimulated a dose-dependent increase in cortisol secretion and was maximally effective at 10(-5) M, at which concentration cortisol secretion was 143.4 +/- 12.9 pmol/well/30 min. Hexahydro-sila-difenidol and para-fluoro-hexa-hydro-sila-difenidol were potent competitive antagonists of ACh-stimulated cortisol secretion, with pA2 values of 8.68 +/- 0.28 and 7.96 +/- 0.29, respectively. Pirenzepine (pA2 = 6.95 +/- 0.28) and methoctramine (pA2 = 6.06 +/- 0.27) were relatively weak competitive antagonists. The pA2 values determined in this study are characteristic of the M3 muscarinic receptor, and we conclude that this receptor subtype mediates ACh-induced cortisol secretion from bovine zona fasciculata/reticularis cells.
