Unilateral ectrodactyly, metatarsal synostosis, and hypoplasia in an Eskimo.	A unilateral foot deformity in an archaeological specimen from Point Hope, Alaska, is presented. Radiographic and gross examination of the bones of the malformed left foot suggests that this adult female suffered from a rare and possibly unique limb deficiency presenting as unilateral congenital absence of the phalanges, synostosis and hypoplasia of the metatarsals, and mild hypoplasia of the calcaneus.
