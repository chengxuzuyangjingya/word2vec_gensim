Impact of progression of Parkinson's disease on drooling in various ethnic groups.	Drooling or sialorrhea is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), and is reported by 35-75% of patients. Drooling is primarily due to impaired swallowing rather than hypersecretion of saliva. In this study, we examined the prevalence of drooling in PD and its relation to various factors such as age, stage of disease, gender and ethnicity.
