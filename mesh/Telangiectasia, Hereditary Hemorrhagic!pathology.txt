Evidence of small-bowel involvement in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a capsule-endoscopic study.	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal-dominant vascular disorder leading to telangiectases and arteriovenous malformations of the skin, mucosa, and viscera. Telangiectases in the upper gastrointestinal tract are known, but data regarding possible small-bowel involvement are scarce due to the technical difficulty of exploring the entire gastrointestinal tract. The aim of the present study was to use capsule endoscopy (CE) to determine the prevalence of small-bowel telangiectases in HHT patients.
