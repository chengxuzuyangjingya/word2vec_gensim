Wound care for burn patients in acute rehabilitation settings.	Caring for patients who are recovering from severe burns is not common in most inpatient rehabilitation settings. Nursing challenges include patients' physical and psychological changes and their high care demands. Harborview Medical Center (HMC), a regional Level 1 burn and trauma center in Seattle, WA, accepted these nursing challenges and developed a successful plan of care consistent with current evidence. This article describes HMC's nursing experiences while caring for patients with burns. Our experiences may assist other rehabilitation units that serve burn patients. Says one burn survivor: "Nurses make a huge difference in recovery, as they are there 24 hours a day. It is their touch, their caring, and their listening that aids the patient in his journey from fire victim to burn survivor."
