Stenosis-jet can cause a dissection of the superficial femoral artery.	A dissection of the superficial femoral artery mainly occurs due to trauma or manipulation of the artery by means of interventional procedures. In contrast to dissections of the carotid arteries which are known to occur spontaneously we present the case of a stenosis of the superficial femoral artery that led to a dissection caused by the stenosis-jet. The dissection on the other hand caused an appositional thrombus which led to the embolic occlusion of the pedal-arteries. In case of peripheral embolisms in patients with or without history of peripheral arterial occlusion disease it is important to look for a causing arterial pathology preferably by duplex sonography.
High frequency color coded duplex ultrasound of small finger arteries--new diagnostic possibilities? A noninvasive method for visualizing digital circulation]	Small vessels with luminal diameters of 0.2-2.0 mm have not been studied with routine ultrasound diagnostic procedures. Modern color Doppler imaging technology, however, should allow visualization of the blood flow even in such small vessels. The present study was therefore aimed at demonstrating the possibilities of examining small arteries in the fingertips of healthy volunteers with color Doppler imaging. The question was whether or not a standardized visualization was possible. We found that small arteries and their blood flow could be demonstrated in all (n = 10) healthy subjects. Furthermore, we demonstrated pathologic findings in the fingertip arteries of a patient with thrombangitis obliterans as an example of the diagnostic value of these new procedures.
