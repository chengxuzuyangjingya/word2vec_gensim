Adrenal zonation: clues from 11beta-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase.	Aldosterone and cortisol are the major mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid produced by the human adrenal. Circulating levels of angiotensin II and potassium control the adrenal production of aldosterone, while the production of cortisol is controlled mainly by adrenocorticotropin. The capacity of the adrenal cortex to differentially produce aldosterone and cortisol relies to a large degree on the expression of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) and 11beta-hydroxylase (CYP11B1). CYP11B2 catalyzes the final steps in the biosynthesis of aldosterone and is expressed solely in the glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, while CYP11B1 catalyzes the final steps in the biosynthesis of cortisol and is expressed in the fasciculata/reticularis. The zonal expression of these two isozymes appears to result from transcriptional regulation of the two genes. Herein, the recent progress in defining the cellular mechanisms that regulate transcription of these two isozymes and thus the capacity of the adrenal gland to differentially produce aldosterone and cortisol is discussed.
Characterization of zona glomerulosa function in patients with classic and non-classic forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency.	The function of the adrenal zona glomerulosa was studied in 18 patients with 11-hydroxylase deficiency confirmed by elevated plasma levels of 11-deoxycortisol. Patients were divided into two groups. Group I (4 males, 7 females; aged 1.2-2.8 yrs) had symptoms at birth or shortly after (classic form), and Group II (4 males, 3 females; aged 7.3-20.1 yrs) had their first clinical manifestation during childhood (non-classic form). To study zona glomerulosa function, patients were given dexamethasone p.o. 2 mg/m2/day x6 days, thus suppressing the zona fasciculata. Six hours after the last dose of dexamethasone, the zona glomerulosa was stimulated by i.v. administration of furosemide 1.0 mg/kg as a single dose. Blood was drawn 2 h later. In the untreated state, all patients had striking elevation of ACTH (Group I: 1,070 +/- 380 pg/ml; Group II: 764 +/- 180 pg/ml), 11-deoxycortisol (Group I: 63,000 +/- 22,000 ng/dl; Group II: 17,200 +/- 5,200 ng/dl) and deoxycorticosterone (Group I: 1,100 +/- 67 ng/dl; Group II: 499 +/- 27 ng%) while plasma renin activity (< 0.5 ng/ml/h in both groups) and aldosterone (Group I: 3.0 +/- 1.8 ng/dl; Group II: 2.3 +/- 1.8 ng/dl) were markedly suppressed. After the administration of furosemide 4 patients in Group I were unable to increase aldosterone (2.8 +/- 0.9 ng/dl) secretion in spite of marked elevation of plasma renin activity (28 +/- 7 ng/ml/h), suggesting an impairment of 11-hydroxylase in the zona glomerulosa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
