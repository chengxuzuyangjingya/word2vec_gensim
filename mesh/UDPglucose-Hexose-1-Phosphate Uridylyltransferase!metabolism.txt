Accumulation of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-galactose in the liver by phosphate and uridylate trapping.	To investigate the highest accumulation of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-galactose ([18F]FdGal) in the liver, metabolic studies with [18F]FdGal were carried out in Wistar rats for 120 min after i.v. injection. As main metabolites 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-galactose 1-phosphate ([18F]FdGal-1-P) and UDP-2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-galactose (UDP-[18F]FdGal) were identified in the liver and other tissues. The [18F]FdGal was phosphorylated by galactokinase. The phosphorylation rate was very rapid in the liver, in which at 5 min after injection 81% of 18F was detected as [18F]FdGal-1-P. After this time the phosphate form decreased with time, which was explained by conversion of [18F]FdGal-1-P to UDP-[18F]FdGal by UDP-glucose: galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. At 120 min after injection 77% of the 18F was measured in the UDP-[18F]FdGal. In the brain both reaction rates were slower than in the liver. Both phosphate and uridylate derivates were also observed as main metabolites in the heart, lung, spleen and small intestine. On the other hand, a small amount of [18F]FdGal-1-P was detected in the plasma, in which the percentage of phosphate increased gradually and was 6% at 120 min. These results show that the [18F]FdGal metabolism in tissue results in phosphate and uridylate trapping and that the [18F]FdGal has potential for measuring in vivo galactose metabolism with positron emission tomography.
Galactose metabolism in Dictyostelium discoideum. Regulation of galactose-1-phosphate-uridyl transferase during growth and development.	Dictyostelium discoideum is able to metabolize [1-14C]galactose to 14CO2 despite the observation that galactose is inhibitory with respect to growth. Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase activity is present throughout growth and development and varies in activity only slightly during the entire life cycle of D. discoideum, in contrast to the rapid increase in UDP-glucose 4-epimerase activity during development. Therefore, in D. discoideum, these two enzymes of the Leloir pathway are independently regulated, unlike E. coli where these enzymes are coordinately controlled.
Physiological role for the GlnK protein of enteric bacteria: relief of NifL inhibition under nitrogen-limiting conditions.	In Klebsiella pneumoniae, NifA-dependent transcription of nitrogen fixation (nif) genes is inhibited by a flavoprotein, NifL, in the presence of molecular oxygen and/or combined nitrogen. We recently demonstrated that the general nitrogen regulator NtrC is required to relieve NifL inhibition under nitrogen (N)-limiting conditions. We provide evidence that the sole basis for the NtrC requirement is its role as an activator of transcription for glnK, which encodes a PII-like allosteric effector. Relief of NifL inhibition is a unique physiological function for GlnK in that the structurally related GlnB protein of enteric bacteria-apparently a paralogue of GlnK-cannot substitute. Unexpectedly, although covalent modification of GlnK by uridylylation normally occurs under N-limiting conditions, several lines of evidence indicate that uridylylation is not required for relief of NifL inhibition. When GlnK was synthesized constitutively from non-NtrC-dependent promoters, it was able to relieve NifL inhibition in the absence of uridylyltransferase, the product of the glnD gene, and under N excess conditions. Moreover, an altered form of GlnK, GlnKY51N, which cannot be uridylylated due to the absence of the requisite tyrosine, was still able to relieve NifL inhibition.
