Anaesthesia for Sturge-Weber syndrome.	A 6-month-old boy with Sturge-Weber syndrome was scheduled for congenital glaucoma and left buphthalmus surgery. Physical examination revealed haemangioma throughout the right trigeminal nerve, congenital glaucoma, left megalocornea and bilateral buphthalmus. Examination of the eye was performed under general anaesthesia, was followed 2 days later by trabeculotomy. No premedication was given to the patient. After induction of anaesthesia with halothane, O2 and N2O muscle relaxation was achieved with atracurium and he was intubated gently. No difference was observed in vital signs during surgery. At the end of the operation he was given oxygen 100% and extubated, muscle relaxant reversal was with atropine and neostigmine. No complication was observed in the post-operative period.
Choroidal effusion after diode laser cyclophotocoagulation in Sturge-Weber syndrome.	Sturge-Weber syndrome is complicated by glaucoma in 30% of patients; of these, 60% develop glaucoma in infancy and 40%, in childhood. Medical treatment often fails to adequately control IOP in these patients, and surgical intervention is frequently necessary. Filtration surgery may be complicated by expulsive choroidal hemorrhage and massive choroidal effusion, more often in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome compared with other patients presenting with glaucoma, particularly in eyes with choroidal hemangioma, because the rapid decrease in IOP during surgery may induce the transudation of fluid from a fragile vessel in the choroidal hemangioma, leading to the development of choroidal effusion. When the risk of drainage surgery is considered too high, diode laser cyclophotocoagulation may, in theory, be a safer treatment to lower the IOP. Our case illustrates that significant but transient choroidal effusions can still occur after diode laser procedure.
