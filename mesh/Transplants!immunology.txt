CXCR3 ligands are associated with the continuum of diffuse alveolar damage to chronic lung allograft dysfunction.	After lung transplantation, insults to the allograft generally result in one of four histopathologic patterns of injury: (1) acute rejection, (2) lymphocytic bronchiolitis, (3) organizing pneumonia, and (4) diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). We hypothesized that DAD, the most severe form of acute lung injury, would lead to the highest risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and that a type I immune response would mediate this process.
Transplant glomerulopathy: the interaction of HLA antibodies and endothelium.	Transplant glomerulopathy (TG) is a major cause of chronic graft dysfunction without effective therapy. Although the histological definition of TG is well characterized, the pathophysiological pathways leading to TG development are still poorly understood. Electron microscopy suggests an earlier appearance of TG and suggests that endothelial cell injury is the first sign of the disease. The pathogenic role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies in endothelial cells has been described in acute vascular and humoral rejection. However the mechanisms and pathways of endothelial cell injury by HLA antibodies remain unclear. Despite the description of different causes of the morphological lesion of TG (hepatitis, thrombotic microangiopathy), the strong link between TG and chronic antibody mediated rejection suggests a major role for HLA antibodies in TG formation. In this review, we describe the effect of classes I or II HLA-antibodies in TG and especially the implication of donor specific antibodies (DSA). We update recent studies about endothelial cells and try to explain the different signals and intracellular pathways involved in the progression of TG.
