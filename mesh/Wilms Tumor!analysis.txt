Intermediate filament proteins as tissue specific markers in normal and malignant urological tissues.	Immunocytochemical techniques have become valuable tools in many fields of clinical pathology and medical research. Especially the development of highly specific (monoclonal) antibodies to a large variety of tissue antigens has in recent years led to the establishment of sensitive tissue markers. One of the most promising types of tissue specific markers so far is represented by the intermediate filament proteins. Since the findings of this rapidly expanding field are also being applied in urology, we have reviewed the current data in order to describe the new insights in tumor biology and histogenesis, as well as their application in diagnostic pathology.
Ultrastructure and histogenesis of the renal tumors of childhood: an overview.	This review discusses the ultrastructural and immunohistochemical features of the common childhood renal tumors, with an emphasis on their diagnostic usefulness. Speculations regarding their histogenesis also are presented, with the hope that these may serve to diminish some of the confusion surrounding the classification of these morphologically diverse lesions.
