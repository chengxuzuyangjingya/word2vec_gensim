Identification of the source of reagent variability in the xanthydrol/urea method.	Contamination of food and food packaging material by rodent urine is evidence of insanitary conditions. Urea from rodent urine is used as a chemical indicator of contamination. The limit of detection of the xanthydrol/urea AOAC Method 959.14 by formation of dixanthylurea crystals is 4 micrograms urea isolated from urine on packaging material. Six different lots of xanthydrol from 5 different manufacturers were compared. Differences in urea detection sensitivity of the xanthydrol of up to 1000-fold were observed. Melting points showed further evidence of variability and impurities in xanthydrol lots. A liquid chromatographic method was developed to separate and identify the impurities. Confirmation of analytes was performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
