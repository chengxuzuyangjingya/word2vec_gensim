Experimental induction of an immunohaemolytic anaemia in the chicken with Salmonella gallinarum endotoxin.	The possibility that the extreme refractoriness of the chicken to injected endotoxin would permit the buildup of sufficient free endotoxin in the circulation to immunologically modify the erythrocytes in vivo and thereby cause them to be eliminated from the circulation was investigated. It was shown that a moderately severe immunohaemolytic anaemia accompanied by a mild spenomegaly could be induced in chickens by single (large) or multiple injections of Salmonella gallinarum endotoxin (SgE). Varying degrees of reticulocytosis, with corresponding decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit values, were observed from the tenth day after the injection of the SgE. All the injected animals also showed significant immune responses to SgE, peak haemagglutinin titres occurring coincidentally with the peaks of the haemolytic episodes. A similar injection schedule in specifically immune chickens also showed the anaemia appearing much earlier, persisting longer and being much more profound in intensity. It is considered that the in vivo erythrocyte sensitization induced by SgE injection initiates the erythrocytic changes observed and that the underlying mechanism responsible for the subsequent development of the haemolytic anaemia is immunologically mediated.
