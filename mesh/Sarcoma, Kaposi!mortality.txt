Kaposi's sarcoma - still an enigma.	Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is an unusual neoplasm that has proved to be an enigma in many ways since its original description in 1872. KS, a vascular tumour that is otherwise rare, is at present the most common neoplasm in patients with AIDS. The lesions contain spindle cells that share features with endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells and are in all likelihood primitive mesenchymal cells that can form vascular channels. These cells are monoclonal in origin indicating therefore that KS is a neoplasm. The presence of a novel type of human herpes virus, KS herpesvirus (KSHV) also called human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV8) in KS lesions support a viral ethiology. KS may be mistaken in the skin for an inflammatory or other lesion, thus skin biopsy is important for correct diagnosis, with the use of immunohistochemistry or molecular biology if needed. Radiation or interferon alpha dominate in the therapeutic approaches.
Suicide by severing blood vessels using local anesthesia: reduced risk in extraction of HIV infected tissue using a stomacher]	Authors report an unusual suicide undertaken by a medical person who after applying the local anesthetic lidocaine, opened a leg vein with a scalpel. The cause of the suicide was presumed advanced AIDS symptoms with a progressive Kaposi sarcoma and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. For the toxicological investigation of the tissue we used the stomacher extraction system, a method not widely known in Forensic science, however, recommended for the extraction of all infectious tissues.
