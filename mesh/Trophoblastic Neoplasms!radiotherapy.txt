Role of surgical therapy and radiotherapy in gestational trophoblastic disease.	Surgical procedures and radiotherapy continue to play a significant role in the management of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) despite continuing advances in chemotherapy. Suction curettage and hysterectomy are preferred techniques for evacuation of hydatidiform mole. Although primary chemotherapy alone is usually successful in women with nonmetastatic or good-prognosis metastatic GTD, hysterectomy is useful in selected patients to decrease the amount of chemotherapy required to produce remission or as salvage therapy in patients who have failed primary chemotherapy. Even among patients with poor-prognosis metastatic GTD, such adjunctive surgical procedures as hysterectomy, thoracotomy and craniotomy may be useful. Whole brain and liver irradiation is employed as adjuvant therapy to reduce hemorrhagic complications of brain and liver metastases.
