Fibrin glue in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery.	Fibrin glue has gained extensive use in Europe in the past decade but remains fairly new to North America. Fibrin glue physiology, its historical background, experimental findings, its present uses and the question of safety are addressed. Results of its use in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery at the Toronto Western Hospital are presented. The authors conclude that fibrin glue is a safe bioadhesive and sealant. It is an excellent adjunct but not a substitute for good surgical techniques.
