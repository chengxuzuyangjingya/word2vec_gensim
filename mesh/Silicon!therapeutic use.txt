Use of silicon-impregnated compresses for echographic detection of section planes during hepatectomies]	It is essential to detect section planes during hepatectomy, notably for limited resections in cirrhotic patients. The authors describe a technical artifice, the use silicon-impregnated compresses, to help in the peroperative ultrasonographic detection of these section planes.
A comparison of 5 gutta-percha obturation techniques to replicate canal defects.	The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of five different methods of compaction of thermoplasticized GP to replicate four artificially-created defects in the canal walls of an extracted tooth. One of the instruments tested was the EndoTwinn which was recently introduced to the U.S. market and can be used in both the warm lateral (WLC) and warm vertical compaction (WVC) techniques.
A biochemical analysis of the possible mechanisms of the ulcerostatic action of atranes]	Stimulatory effect of metalloatrans on the development of stomach wall connective tissue components was examined in rats with experimental acetate ulcer. Metalloatrans were shown to inhibit peroxide oxidation processes of lipids in blood and stomach tissue.
Central nervous system inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion by insulin-like growth factor II.	The ability of intracisternal insulin-like growth factor II (IGF II) to inhibit gastric acid secretion was studied in rats. Centrally-administered IGF II dose-dependently inhibited acid secretion stimulated by pentagastrin. The effect was abolished by vagotomy. IGF II did not inhibit acid secretion stimulated by histamine or PCP-GABA.
