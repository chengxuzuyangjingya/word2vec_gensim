Mechanisms of the genoprotective action of a phytoecdysteroid drug (BTK-8L) in chromatin damage by chlorofos]	Genoprotective effect of preparation BTK-8L from plant steroids at prophylactic injection to experimental animals at chromatin damage by chlorofos was revealed. Antioxidant action of the preparation, being most highly expressed in the transcriptionally active chromatin fraction, is, probably, the most likely mechanism of the action. The realization of this action might be carried out as a result of the direct binding of BTK-8L with the chromatin protein-lipid complex, which was revealed during the analysis of the model systems showing binding of the preparation with chromatin fractions in vitro. Correction of structural chromatin organization and its transcriptional activity modified with intoxication of animals by chlorofos may occur as a result of such binding. Genoprotective properties in BTK-8L correlate to some extent with the lowering of the death rate of experimental animals at the early stage of intoxication by chlorofos at the prophylactic injection of the preparation, which, nevertheless, was not so significant, as in the case of intoxication by tetrachloromethane. Such fact allowed suggesting the existence of delayed unfavourable consequences for the organism (mutagenesis, cancerogenesis) as a result of the realization of the genotoxic action of chlorofos.
