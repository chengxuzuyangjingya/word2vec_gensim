Delayed occurrence of intracranial supratentorial chondroma following compound depressed skull fracture.	We describe an exceptional case of a frontal convexity chondroma arising at the site of a compound depressed skull fracture operated on 12 years earlier. We conclude that intracranial chondroma should be included in the differential diagnosis of a calcified mass for the patients who had had a compound, depressed skull fracture along the suture line, especially in cases of dural laceration by the fragmented bone.
