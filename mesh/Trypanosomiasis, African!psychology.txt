Melatonin and its new agonist S-20098 restore synchronized sleep fragmented by experimental trypanosome infection in the rat.	The experimental infection with the parasite Trypanosoma brucei in the rat provides a unique model of dysfunction of the sleep regulatory mechanisms, because the length of synchronized sleep episodes is selectively and dramatically reduced in the advanced stages of the disease. In the present study, melatonin was acutely administered (3 mg/kg SC) to trypanosome-infected rats, before the sleep onset. This treatment resulted in a significant increase of the length of synchronized sleep episodes in respect to the infected animals and to those that had received only the vehicle. Thus, melatonin restored a normal sleep pattern during the infection. Similar findings were obtained with the new melatonin agonist S-20098. The sleep parameters were not significantly modified by either melatonin or S-20098 acute administration to noninfected animals. These findings indicate that exogenous melatonin and S-20098 exert a selective regulatory action on sleep fragmentation during experimental trypanosomiasis.
