Utilizing a polymerase chain reaction method for the detection of Toxocara canis and T. cati eggs in soil.	A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique has been used for the differentiation of T. canis and T. cati eggs isolated from soil and previously identified from microscopical observations. The method, using specific primers for the identification of the two Toxocara species, was assessed in both the field and laboratory. Successful results were obtained when only a single or large numbers of eggs were recovered from 40 g soil samples. The method is sensitive, allows analysis of material independent of the stage of egg development and can be adapted for the recovery of other species of parasites from soil.
