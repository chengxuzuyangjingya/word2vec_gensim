Evidence for sensory neuropathy and pharmacologic management.	Recent literature points to postviral sensory neuropathy as a possible cause for refractory chronic cough. Vagal neuropathy may affect the sensory branches, inducing chronic cough or laryngospasm.

This article highlights the clinical picture of this disease and the efficacy, side-effect profiles of the currently used pharmacological interventions.
