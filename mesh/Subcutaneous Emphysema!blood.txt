Bilateral spontaneous pneumothoraces, pneumopericardium, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema: a rare presentation of paraquat intoxication.	Pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumomediastinum occur frequently in critically ill patients in association with blunt or penetrating injuries or other conditions while performing Valsalva-like maneuvers. We present the case of a patient with bilateral pneumothoraces, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, and subcutaneous emphysema after acute paraquat intoxication.
Effect of subcutaneous carbon dioxide insufflation on arterial pCO2.	Subcutaneous emphysema following laparoscopy could result in postoperative respiratory acidosis from prolonged CO2 absorption. We studied the magnitude and duration of alterations in PaCO2 coincident with direct CO2 insufflation into the subcutaneous fat of the anterior abdominal wall of 5 anesthetized juvenile pigs.
