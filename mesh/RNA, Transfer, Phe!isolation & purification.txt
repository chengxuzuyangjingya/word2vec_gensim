Preparative isolation of individual tRNA Phe by high performance liquid reversed-phase chromatography]	A method of rapid preparative isolation of Phe-tRNA(Phe) (E. coli) of almost 100% purity (1800 pmoles per 1 OE260) is developed. In includes three successive chromatographies of total tRNA on C18-modified Lichrosphere Si-1000 in acetonitrile gradients. Other individual tRNAs can be isolated by the same approach.
