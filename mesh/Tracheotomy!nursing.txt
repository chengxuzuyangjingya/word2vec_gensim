Tracheal resection and reconstruction: indications, surgical procedure, and postoperative care.	Nursing management of the patient undergoing tracheal resection and reconstruction is not well described in the literature. Over the last 25 years, nurses in the respiratory surgical intensive care unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston have cared for more than 600 patients who have undergone this procedure. Using a diagnostic format, we have developed a plan of care for this patient population. In this article, the etiology of tracheal obstruction, its diagnosis and surgical correction, and nursing care of the patient after tracheal resection and reconstruction are presented.
Pediatric tracheotomy discharge teaching: a comprehensive checklist format.	Discharge planning for a child undergoing a tracheotomy is a complex process. In 1989, a multidisciplinary team at Children's Hospital of Michigan developed specific discharge criteria in a checklist format to address all facets of home care for these patients. We present and discuss the checklist. A survey of user satisfaction with the checklist demonstrated that 80% of parents and care-givers felt well-prepared by this format at the time their child was discharged from the hospital with a new tracheotomy. We conclude that the protocol allows for comprehensive and efficient discharge teaching of parents and care-givers for children with new tracheotomies.
