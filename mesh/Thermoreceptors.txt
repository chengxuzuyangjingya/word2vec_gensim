Innervation of the canine cruciate ligaments. A neurohistological study.	A search for mechanoreceptors within the substance of the cruciate ligaments was undertaken using the modified gold-chloride technique. Abundant Pacinian, Vater-Pacini, Ruffini end organs and Ruffini-type receptors were found within the substance of the anterior and posterior cruciates. The receptors were innervated by axons of 5 to 10 micrometers in diameter penetrating from the synovium investing the ligaments. The findings support the contention that the cruciate ligaments have important mechanoreceptive and proprioceptive functions.
