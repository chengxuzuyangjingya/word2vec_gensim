Temporal small-vessel inflammation in patients with giant cell arteritis: clinical course and preliminary immunohistopathologic characterization.	To investigate the occurrence, clinical correlates, and immunohistochemical phenotype of temporal small-vessel inflammation (TSVI) in temporal artery biopsies from patients presenting with clinical features of giant cell arteritis (GCA).
Increased IL-17A expression in temporal artery lesions is a predictor of sustained response to glucocorticoid treatment in patients with giant-cell arteritis.	Interleukin 17A (IL-17A) exerts pivotal proinflammatory functions in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
