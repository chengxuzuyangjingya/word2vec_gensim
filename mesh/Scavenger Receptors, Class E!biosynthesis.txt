The induction of human CL-P1 expression in hypoxia/reoxygenation culture condition and rat CL-P1 after ischemic/reperfusion treatment.	Oxidative stress-induced endothelial dysfunction and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) might play a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We recently identified a vascular endothelial scavenger receptor, collectin placenta 1 (CL-P1), which acts as a receptor for oxidized LDL as well as for microbes.
