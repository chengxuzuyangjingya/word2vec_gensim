Vacuum-assisted closure therapy for exposed vascular prosthesis in the groin]	Groin infections are a severe complication in vascular surgery. The treatment of a groin infection with exposed vascular prosthetic material is challenging. Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) is a therapy frequently used to close wounds. In groin wounds with exposed vascular prosthetic material, however, VAC has been contraindicated because of the risk of bleeding. We successfully treated 17 groin infections with exposed vascular prosthetic material from 2009 to 2011 by using a double-sponge technique (a combination of polyvinyl alcohol and polyurethane sponges and a continuous negative pressure of 50 mmHg); there were no complications involving haemorrhaging, amputations or re-infection. At a median follow-up duration of 380 days, no further complications occurred and all prostheses could be retained. The double-sponge technique appears to be an effective and simple method for closing an infected groin with preservation of the underlying prosthetic material.
