Ventricular function and Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity and distribution with chronic supraventricular tachycardia.	The molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the dilated cardiomyopathy associated with chronic supraventricular tachycardia are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to examine Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity and distribution in a pacing induced model of dilated cardiomyopathy.
