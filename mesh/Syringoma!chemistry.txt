New concepts on the histogenesis of eccrine neoplasia from keratin expression in the normal eccrine gland, syringoma and poroma.	Peripheral and luminal layers of eccrine sweat gland ducts are self-renewing structures. Proliferation is restricted to the lowermost luminal layer, but randomly scattered in the peripheral layer. Each layer exhibits differential expression of keratins K5/K14 and K6/K16. Keratin K1 occurs only in peripheral cells and the novel keratin K77 is specific for luminal cells.
Sclerosing sweat-duct carcinoma (malignant syringoma) of the upper eyelid: a patient report with immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis.	Sclerosing sweat-duct carcinoma or malignant syringoma is a rare eyelid tumor. The authors report the first patient with sclerosing sweat-duct carcinoma involving the upper eyelid and present its immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features. The clinical features and the histopathologic and ultrastructural findings that distinguish this tumor from its benign counterparts are discussed. Sclerosing sweat-duct carcinomas are slow growing but locally invasive neoplasms that have a propensity to recur. Wide and deep surgical excision with frozen section evaluation of margins is recommended.
