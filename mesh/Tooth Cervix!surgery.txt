Modification of col shape and interproximal area after periodontal surgery associated with the restorative alveolar interface (RAI) technique. Histological study in dogs.	The modification of the col shape and position by the restorative alveolar interface technique (RAI) was studied in the interproximal areas between the mandibular first molars and fourth premolars of 10 dogs. Full thickness flaps were raised to expose the interproximal root surface and alveolar bone crest. The RAI procedure was performed only on the experimental sides and the control areas were the opposite side of the same animal. The animals were sacrificed at zero hour, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days for histological analyses. Approximately 6.0-micron-thick sections were made in buccolingual and mesiodistal directions and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Mallory for light microscopy analysis. A satisfactory healing process was observed up to the 14th and 21st days which showed a modified col shape. At this time, an inflammatory reaction developed affecting the evolution of the healing. The surgery had probably created conditions for the installation of an inflammatory process resulting from the modified anatomy of the interdental area.
