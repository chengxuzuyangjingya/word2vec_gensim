Molecular basis for the deficiency in humans of gulonolactone oxidase, a key enzyme for ascorbic acid biosynthesis.	The inability of humans to synthesize L-ascorbic acid is known to be due to a lack of L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, an enzyme that is required for the biosynthesis of this vitamin. Isolation of a cDNA for rat L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase allowed us to study the basic defect underlying this deficiency at the gene level and led to isolation of a human genomic clone related to L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase as well as three overlapping clones covering the entire coding region of the rat L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase cDNA. Sequence analysis study indicated that the human L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase gene has accumulated a large number of mutations since it stopped being active and that it now exists as a pseudogene in the human genome.
L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase deficiency in rats with osteogenic disorder: enzymological and immunochemical studies.	A strain of Wistar rats with L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase deficiency has recently been established. The activity of L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase in hepatic microsomes of the mutant rats was not detectable, while that of heterozygous rats was about half that of normal rats. These results were confirmed by immunological quantitation using antibody directed against this enzyme. Thus, it appears that these mutant rats either possess no enzyme at all or a very aberrant form of the enzyme in the liver. Aldonolactonase, another enzyme participating in the biosynthesis of L-ascorbic acid, was found to be present in normal amount in the mutant strain.
