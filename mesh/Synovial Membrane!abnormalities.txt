Does the meniscus exist in the elbow joint in children?	The authors report a case of meniscus at the elbow joint in a 15-month-old infant causing a limitation of elbow extension. Histological examination demonstrated that this tissue was not a synovial fold or a chondroid metaplasia of the synovial fold. As a meniscus does not appear at any stage of the embryological evolution of the elbow joint, it has been concluded that the presence of the meniscus can be considered as an abnormal condition.
