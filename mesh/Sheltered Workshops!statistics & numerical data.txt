Psychiatric vocational therapy--concepts, practice and scientifically-based results]	Work therapy is a widespread form of socio-therapy. In contrast to pharmacological and somatic forms of treatment, proof of efficacy is difficult to produce in multimodal therapy of psychiatric patients. Within the framework of an extensive study on vocational rehabilitation of mentally ill patients, we carried out a naturalistic follow-up study of 112 mostly schizophrenic patients attending outpatient work therapy programmes. The courses of illness and rehabilitation were documented prospectively over a three-year period. At the end of the study 23% of the patients were integrated into the open labour market, 25% were working in sheltered employment, 25% remained in work therapy, and 27% were unemployed. Controlled studies with schizophrenic patients show, that work therapy contributes to improved vocational integration, a reduction of rehospitalizations and a stabilisation of the psychopathological status.
