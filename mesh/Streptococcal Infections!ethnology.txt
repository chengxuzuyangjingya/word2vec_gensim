End-stage renal disease and acute glomerulonephritis in Goajiro Indians.	Goajiro Indians are a semi-nomad tribe that live on the Goajiro peninsula, in the northwestern part of Venezuela. We investigated the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) among Goajiros and to determine if it was increased and whether congenital endowment of low number of nephrons (as indicated by low birth weight) was a contributing factor in their predisposition to chronic renal failure (CRF).
