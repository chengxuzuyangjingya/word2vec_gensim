Successful management of a thick transverse vaginal septum with a vesicovaginal fistula by vaginal expansion and surgery.	We present a case of a thick transverse vaginal septum with a vesicovaginal fistula treated with vaginal expansion using dilators, followed by surgery. A 27-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with vaginal atresia and cyclical hematuria. Urethroscopy and cystography showed a vesicovaginal fistula between the proximal vagina and bladder. The vaginal septum was 4 cm thick. Over a 6-month period, the distal vagina was expanded with the use of dilators and the septum was sufficiently thinned. Reconstruction using a transvaginal and transabdominal approach created a direct anastomosis between the proximal and distal vagina. No vaginal strictures or contractures in the anastomotic region have been observed during the 12 months following surgery. The combination of expansion and subsequent reconstructive surgery for the treatment of a thick transverse vaginal septum with a vesicovaginal fistula was less invasive than alternative surgical approaches and provided the desired outcome.
