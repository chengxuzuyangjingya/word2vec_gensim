Ductal variation of the sublingual gland: a predisposing factor for ranula formation.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate ranula development according to anatomic variation of the sublingual gland (SLG).
A bilateral, superficial location of human sublingual glands: report of a case.	During a routine dissection of a cadaver, the unusual, completely superficial position of both sublingual glandular masses was noticed. Histologically, the glandular masses consisted of a group of minor sublingual glands. It is suggested that the existence of a wide gap between the anterior and posterior parts of the mylohyoid muscle, which was revealed during further dissection, was the primary embryologic anomaly that was responsible for the unusual location of the glands.
