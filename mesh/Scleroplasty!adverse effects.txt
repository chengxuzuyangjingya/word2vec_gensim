Long-term results of scleroplasty surgery in children]	The authors presents results of scleroplastic operations in 411 children (773 eyes) followed up to 7 years after surgery: Most frequently eyes with the diagnosis myopia progressiva (397 = 51.4%) and myopia gravis (330 = 12.7%) were operated. The mean age at the time of operation was 12.2 +/- 3.0 years myopia progressiva and 10.8 +/- 3.9 years in myopia gravis. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0002). The visual acuity was on average better throughout the follow-up period in both main diagnoses, as compared with initial values. The progression of myopia (subjective refraction) slowed down markedly after surgery and was 0.26 D/year in myopia progressiva and 0.23 D/year in myopia gravis. The authors recommend scleroplasty to prevent significant progression of myopia and for longterm preservation of visual functions.
