Effect of fosfidomycin on development of various infections in mice]	Antibiotic fosmidomycin will know as inhibitor of the nonmevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis and as possible antimalarial drug, was shown to possess a certain protective effect on mice experimentally infected with tularemia, tiphus or coli-septicemia. Positive effect on mice with chronic form of tuberculosis was not observed when the animals were given 1 mg of fosmidomycin per capita twice a day. Under oxidative conditions an ESR signal of long living nitroxil free radicals were registered in the water solution of fosmidomycin. The radicals are supposed to be involved in the therapeutic effect of the antibiotic.
