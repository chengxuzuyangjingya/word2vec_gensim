Genetic diversity of microsatellite loci in fifty-six Chinese native pig breeds.	The genetic diversity of fifty-six indigenous pig breeds in China, and three introduced pig breeds (Duroc, Landrace and Large White) was surveyed using twenty-seven microsatellites recommended by the International Society for Animal Genetics (IS-AG) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). By means of the allele frequencies, mean heterozygosity, effective number of alleles, estimator of gene differentiation, polymorphism information content, genetic distance and dendrogram analysis, the genetic variability and population structure of native pig breeds were estimated. Genetic variabilities within native pig breeds are as follows: Effective number of alleles vary from 2.12 to 9.03, from 0.44 to 0.87 for mean heterozygosity, from 0.39 to 0.86 for polymorphism information content. Nei's genetic distance and Nei's standard genetic distance were estimated and used to construct UPGMA and NJ dendrograms, which were evaluated by the bootstrap test. Fifty-six Chinese indigenous pig breeds were clustered into twelve groups based on the dendrogram. Compared with the classification in Pig Breeds in China, I, II and III groups in the study are equivalent to North-China type, IV group basically accords with Lower-Changjiang River Basin type, V, VI, VII, VIII and IX groups quite correspond with Central-China type, X and XI group largely correspond to South-China type, the last group, XII is equal to South-west type at large. Suggestions that the conservation farms together with conservation areas are appropriate methods for the preservation of native pig breeds in our country were proposed. The results could provide basic molecular data for the research on the germplasm characteristics of local breeds in our country and scientific basis for the conservation and utilization of those breeds.
Genetic analysis of 32 microsatellite loci in 13 families of Wuzhishan pig by multiplex PCR and gene scanning technique]	Wuzhishan pig is one of the rare and endangered breeds in china. They have the following characteristics such as :light body weight and small size, early sexually maturity, high meat quality and genetic identification with 6 approximately 8 pares litter size,body weight of born 0.3 approximately 0.4 kg, 15 approximately 16 kg at 6 month old, 35 kg at 2 years old, and so on. They may be used for laboratory utilization, comparative studies on human medical model, embryonic engineering, nutrition metabolism, sensitivity test on virus and bacteria, skin brut and tranfer, removing lipid, teeth and mouth cavity diseases, studies on cardiovascular model and evaluation of new medicine products. The polymorphisms of 32 microsatellites in 13 families of Wuzhishan pig in Hainan were Analysed. Number of alleles in each family was counted, mean heterozygosity and polymorphism Information content(PIC) were calculated. The results showed that number of alleles was 13.66, mean heterozygosity was 0.559 while polymorphism information content was 0.731. This revealed that genetic diversity is abundant in Wuzhishan pig in Hainan. These results have instructional significance for preserving breeds, selection and breeding, development and utilization of Wuzhishan pig in Hainan.
Detection of novel quantitative trait loci for cutaneous melanoma by genome-wide scan in the MeLiM swine model.	Human cutaneous melanoma is a complex trait inherited in about 10% of cases. Although 2 high-risk genes, CDKN2A and CDK4, and 1 low risk gene, MC1R, have been identified, susceptibility genes remain to be discovered. Here, we attempted to determine new genomic regions linked to melanoma using the pig MeLiM strain, which develops hereditary cutaneous melanomas. We applied quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping method to a significant genome-wide scan performed on 331 backcross pigs derived from this strain. QTLs were detected at chromosome-wide level for a melanoma synthetic trait corresponding to the development of melanoma. The peak positions on Sus scrofa chromosomes (SSC) were at 49.4 and 88.0 cM (SSC1), 56.0 cM (SSC13), 86.5 cM (SSC15) and 39.8 cM (SSC17), and, on SSC2, at 16.9 cM, in families derived from F1 males only (p < 0.05, except for SSC13, p < 0.01). Analysis of 7 precise specific traits revealed highly significant QTLs on SSC10 (ulceration), on SSC12 (presence of melanoma at birth), on SSC13 (lesion type), and on SSC16 and SSC17 (number of aggressive melanomas) at the respective positions 42.0, 95.6, 81.0, 45.3 and 44.8 cM (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 respectively at the chromosome- and genome-wide levels). We also showed that MeLiM MC1R*2 allele, which determines black coat colour in pigs, predisposes significantly to melanoma. Interactions were observed between MC1R and markers located on SSC1 (p < 0.05). Taken together, these results indicate that MeLiM swine is a model for human multigenic diseases. Comparative mapping revealed human regions of interest to search for new melanoma susceptibility candidates.
Genetic correlations between two strains of Durocs and crossbreds from differing production environments for slaughter traits.	The aim of this study was to estimate the genetic correlations between 2 purebred Duroc pig populations (P1 and P2) and their terminal crossbreds [C1 = P1 x (Landrace x Large White) and C2 = P2 x (Landrace x Large White)] raised in different production environments. The traits analyzed were backfat (BF), muscle depth (MD), BW at slaughter (WGT), and weight per day of age (WDA). Data sets from P1, P2, C1, and C2 included 26,674, 8,266, 16,806, and 12,350 animals, respectively. Two-trait models (nucleus and commercial crossbreds) for each group included fixed (contemporary group, sex, weight, and age), random additive (animal for P1 and P2 and sire for C1 and C2), random litter, and random dam (C1 and C2 only) effects. Heritability estimates (+/-SE) for BF were 0.46 +/- 0.04, 0.38 +/- 0.02, 0.32 +/- 0.02, and 0.33 +/- 0.02 for P1, P2, C1, and C2, respectively. Heritability estimates for MD were 0.31 +/- 0.01, 0.23 +/- 0.02, 0.19 +/- 0.01, and 0.12 +/- 0.01 for P1, P2, C1, and C2, respectively. The estimates for WGT and WDA were 0.31 +/- 0.01, 0.21 +/- 0.02, 0.16 +/- 0.01, and 0.18 +/- 0.01 and 0.32 +/- 0.01, 0.22 +/- 0.02, 0.16 +/- 0.01, and 0.19 +/- 0.01, respectively. Genetic correlations between purebreds and crossbreds for BF were 0.83 +/- 0.09 (P1 x C1) and 0.89 +/- 0.05 (P2 x C2), for MD 0.78 +/- 0.05 (P1 x C1) and 0.80 +/- 0.08 (P2 x C2). For WGT and WDA, the correlations were 0.53 +/- 0.08 (P1 x C1), 0.80 +/- 0.10 (P2 x C2), and 0.60 +/- 0.07 (P1 x C1) and 0.79 +/- 0.09 (P2 x C2), respectively. (Co)variances in crossbreds were adjusted to a live BW scale. Compared with purebreds, the genetic variances in crossbreds were lower, and the residual variances were greater. Sire variances in crossbreds were approximately 20 to 30% of the animal variances in purebreds for BF and MD but were 13 to 25% for WGT and WDA. The efficiency of purebred selection on crossbreds, assessed by EBV prediction weights, ranged from 0.43 to 0.91 for line 1 and 0.70 to 0.92 for line 2. When nucleus and commercial environments differ substantially, the efficiency of selection varies by line and traits, and selection strategies that include crossbred data from typical production environments may therefore be desirable.
Genetic parameters for reproduction and production traits of Landrace sows in Thailand.	Data from Thai Landrace sows were used to estimate genetic parameters for reproduction and production traits in first and later parities. The reproduction traits investigated were total number of piglets born per litter (TB), number of stillborn piglets (SB), and number of piglets born alive but dead within 24 h (BAD). The reproduction data pertained to 12,603 litters born between 1993 and 2005. The production measures were ADG and backfat thickness (BF); these were recorded in 4,163 boars and 15,171 gilts. Analyses were carried out with a multivariate animal model using average information REML procedures. Heritability estimates of reproduction traits for first parity were 0.03 +/- 0.02 for TB, 0.04 +/- 0.02 for SB, and 0.06 +/- 0.02 for BAD. For later parities, they were 0.07 +/- 0.01 for TB, 0.03 +/- 0.04 for SB, and 0.02 +/- 0.01 for BAD. Heritability estimates for production traits were 0.38 +/- 0.02 for ADG and 0.61 +/- 0.02 for BF. Genetic correlations between ADG and TB tended to be favorable, and genetic correlations between BF and TB tended to be unfavorable in all parities. However, BF was genetically correlated unfavorably with SB in later parities, and the genetic correlations between TB and BAD tended to be unfavorable in all parities. The genetic correlations of TB, SB, and BAD between first and later parities were 0.85 +/- 0.13, 0.79 +/- 0.16, and 0.71 +/- 0.24, respectively. Selection for high growth rate will probably increase TB, and selection for low BF will decrease TB and increase SB. The results obtained also indicated that BAD will increase if there is selection pressure for high TB.
Dietary B vitamin needs of strains of pigs with high and moderate lean growth.	Ten sets of 5 littermate pigs from each of 2 genetic strains were utilized to determine the impact of the dietary concentration of 5 B vitamins (riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, cobalamin, and folacin) on growth from 9 to 28 kg of BW in pigs with high or moderate capacity for lean growth. All pigs (penned individually) were reared via a segregated, early weaning scheme, so that the lean growth potential of each strain could be expressed. The basal diet provided the 5 test vitamins at concentrations of total and estimated bioavailability equivalent to a minimum of 100 and 70%, respectively, of their estimated requirements (NRC, 1998) for 5- to 10-kg pigs. At a BW of 9 +/- 0.9 kg, pigs within each litter were allotted to the basal diet supplemented with sources of the 5 test vitamins equivalent to an additional 0, 100, 200, 300, or 400% (bioavailable) of the NRC requirements. Pigs from the high lean strain consumed less feed (P < 0.05) and gained BW faster (P < 0.02) and more efficiently (P < 0.01) than pigs of the moderate lean strain. In both lean strains, the rate and efficiency of growth were improved (P < 0.01) as dietary B vitamin concentrations were increased. However, the dietary B vitamin concentrations needed to optimize G:F were greater (P < 0.03) in the high (>470% of NRC, 1998) vs. moderate (270%) lean strain. Based on these data, the dietary needs for 1 or more of the 5 B vitamins are greater than current NRC (1998) estimates, particularly in pigs expressing a high rate of lean tissue growth. The greater need for these vitamins is not associated with greater dietary energy intake or body energy accretion rate but is potentially due to shifts in the predominant metabolic pathways.
Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) for the first time in Casertana pig breed.	Lymphocyte cell cultures from 30 Casertana pigs (13 males and 17 females), reared in southern Italy, underwent the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test. The Casertana pig is an endangered native breed from the region of Campania, raised chiefly half-wild. In the 1500 cells we studied, the mean SCE was 6.32+/-2.92 and SCE frequency did not follow a Poisson distribution. A higher mean value of SCE cell(-1) was found in the older group (SCE cell(-1)=6.68+/-2.95) compared with the younger (SCE cell(-1)=5.94+/-2.84), the difference being statistically significant (P<0.01). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation in a representative sample of Italian pig breed using the SCE test. Furthermore, this is the first report where the differences found in the mean SCE values were related to age in domestic species.
Diet-induced swine model with obesity/leptin resistance for the study of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.	The objective of the present study was to determine the suitability of a swine breed with leptin resistance and predisposition to obesity (the Iberian pig) as model for studies on metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Thus, six Iberian sows had ad libitum access to food enriched with saturated fat (SFAD group; food consumption was estimated to be 4.5 kg/animal/day) whilst four females acted as controls and were fed with 2 kg/animal/day of a commercial maintenance diet. After three months of differential feeding, SFAD animals developed central obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance, and elevated blood pressure; the five parameters associated with the metabolic syndrome. Thus, the current study characterizes the Iberian pig as a robust, amenable, and reliable translational model for studies on nutrition-associated diseases.
Expression patterns and promoter activity analysis of UGP2 in pigs.	The function of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 gene (UGP2) in pig is not clear. In the present study, we used RNA isolated from Large White pigs and Chinese indigenous MeiShan pigs to examine the temporal coordination of changes in gene expression within muscle tissues. We cloned both the complete genomic DNA sequence and 2077-bp 5ꞌ-flanking sequence of porcine UGP2, to determine the genomic sequence. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that UGP2 was highly expressed in liver and skeletal muscle of MeiShan pigs. Among different types of muscle fibers, the UGP2 had the highest expression in both soleus muscle and longissimus dorsi in Large White pigs. In the progression of muscle fibers at different growth stages, UGP2 plays a role in the early days after birth in Large White pigs, while in MeiShan pigs it is important later. Furthermore, the 5ꞌ-flanking sequence we cloned exhibited the promoter activity of UGP2, and the sequence 588 bp upstream from the transcriptional site had the greatest activity.
