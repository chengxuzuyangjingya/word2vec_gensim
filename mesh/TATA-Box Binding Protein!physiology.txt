Separation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Paf1 complex from RNA polymerase II results in changes in its subnuclear localization.	The yeast Paf1 complex (Paf1C), composed of Paf1, Ctr9, Cdc73, Rtf1, and Leo1, associates with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at promoters and in the actively transcribed portions of mRNA genes. Loss of Paf1 results in severe phenotypes and significantly reduced levels of the other Paf1C components. In contrast, loss of Rtf1 causes relatively subtle phenotypic changes and no reduction in the other Paf1C factors but disrupts the association of these factors with Pol II and chromatin. To elucidate the fate of the Paf1C when dissociated from Pol II, we examined the localization of the Paf1C components in paf1 and rtf1 mutant yeast strains. We found that although the Paf1C factors remain nuclear in paf1 and rtf1 strains, loss of Paf1 or Rtf1 results in a change in the subnuclear distribution of the remaining factors. In wild-type cells, Paf1C components are present in the nucleoplasm but not the nucleolus. In contrast, in both paf1 and rtf1 strains, the remaining factors are found in the nucleolus as well as the nucleoplasm. Loss of Paf1 affects nucleolar function; we observed that expression of MAK21 and RRP12, important for rRNA processing, is reduced concomitant with an increase in rRNA precursors in a paf1 strain. However, these changes are not the result of relocalization of the Paf1C because loss of Rtf1 does not cause similar changes in rRNA processing. Instead, we speculate that the change in localization may reflect a link between the Paf1C and newly synthesized mRNAs as they exit the nucleus.
