Moxifloxacin-acetaminophen-warfarin interaction during bacille Calmette-Guerin treatment for bladder cancer.	The case of a patient receiving long-term anticoagulation with warfarin who had supratherapeutic International Normalized Ratios (INRs) after receiving concomitant acetaminophen and moxifloxacin as prophylaxis with bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) therapy for bladder cancer is reported.
Chlorophacinone intoxication. A biological and toxicological study.	Plasma chlorophacinone determinations were performed in three cases of intoxication. The data collected in this study confirm the particularly prolonged anticoagulant effect of this compound and show that the knowledge of plasma concentrations may be very useful for clinicians since it allows to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate the duration of the treatment. The determination of half-lives was investigated and the results indicate that the greater the quantity absorbed, the longer the half-life. The effect of phenobarbital on the elimination of cholorophacinone could be studied in one case. An increased elimination was noted when phenobarbital was administered.
Successful prevention of coumarin-induced hemorrhagic skin necrosis by timely administration of vitamin k1.	Successful prevention of the progression of incipient hemorrhagic skin necrosis by timely administration of vitamin K1 in a woman treated with phenprocoumon is presented. From a critical review of the literature strong evidence emerges that coumarin necrosis does only occur in cases with severe initial drug induced hypocoagulability. Non- recognition thusfar of its importance is due to insufficient knowledge of the biological activities of thromboplastin preparations presently used in the laboratory control of oral anticoagulation. All well documented cases with apparently adequate Quick values were monitored with Faktor VIII insensitive thromboplastin. Therefore, such preparations should no longer be used in anticoagulant control.
