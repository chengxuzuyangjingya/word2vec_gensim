Serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and cavity formation in active pulmonary tuberculosis.	In active pulmonary tuberculosis, certain cytokines have been postulated to be related to cavity formation, although the detailed mechanism of cavity formation is not yet known.
Value of serum-vascular endothelial growth factor in the differential diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodule]	To evaluate serum-vascular endothelial growth factor (S-VEGF) in the differentiation of solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN).
Serum proteomic patterns may assist the diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodules]	To screen relatively specific biomarkers in serum from lung adenocarcinoma patients by surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOFMS), and to investigate the clinical value of SELDI-TOF-MS in differentiation of benign from malignant solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN).
Segmentectomy for giant pulmonary sclerosing haemangiomas with high serum KL-6 levels.	We describe a 61-year old female patient with a giant pulmonary sclerosing haemangioma (PSH) and an extremely high preoperative serum KL-6 level. During an annual health screening, the patient showed a posterior mediastinal mass on chest radiography. Chest computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-circumscribed 60 mm diameter nodule with a marked contrast enhancement in the left lower lobe. The preoperative serum KL-6 level was elevated to 8204 U/ml. We performed a four-port thoracoscopic basal segmentectomy and lymph node sampling for diagnosis and therapy. The postoperative diagnosis showed PSH. The serum KL-6 level decreased dramatically with tumour resection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with PSH showing a high serum KL-6 level.
