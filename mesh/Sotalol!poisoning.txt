Intoxication with beta-receptor blockers (author's transl)]	Beta-blockers are increasingly often used with suicidal intent, but are also sometimes swallowed accidentally by small children. Beta-blockers available in the Federal Republic of Germany differ in their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. After analysing 49 cases of intoxication, no certain relationship was found between the different substances and specific symptoms. Cardiovascular signs such as sinus bradycardia, arrhythmia, hypotension (30 cases), as well as dizziness and drowziness (17) were the most frequent ones. Loss of consciousness and hallucination (13), as well as seizures (3), also occurred frequently. Hypoglycaemia or symptoms due to it (12) were noted especially in young children. In addition to primary removal of the drug, repeated administration of charcoal and sodium sulphate are recommended with most of the drugs for interrupting the enterohepatic circulation. Administration of atropine for bradycardia and hypotension was usually not effective. Dopamine is recommended; glucagon for definite signs of shock. Haemodialysis is indicated only in exceptional instances and is effective for only a few of the drugs. Forced diuresis should not be practised.
