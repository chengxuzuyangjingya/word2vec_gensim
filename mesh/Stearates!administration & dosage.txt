Antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics of liposomes containing lipophilic gemcitabine prodrugs.	Gemcitabine is a deoxycytidine analogue that exhibits antitumoral activity against adenocarcinomas of the colon, lung and pancreas. After intravenous injection, gemcitabine is rapidly converted to the inactive metabolite 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorouridine by cytidine deaminase.
