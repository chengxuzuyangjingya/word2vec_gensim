Synergistic effects of adenosine A2A antagonist and L-DOPA on rotational behaviors in 6-hydroxydopamine-induced hemi-Parkinsonian mouse model.	In this study, we examined the combination effects of L-DOPA and adenosine receptor antagonists on rotational behaviors in a hemi-Parkinsonian mouse model induced by unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection. The adenosine A(2A) antagonist SCH-58261, but not the A(1)-receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine or A(2B)-receptor antagonist alloxazine, synergistically potentiated the L-DOPA-induced rotational behaviors in the 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. In addtion, the 6-OHDA-induced lesions of the dopaminergic system did not affect the in vivo binding of an adenosine A(2A)-receptor tracer [(11)C]SCH-442416 in the striatatum. These findings suggest that adenosine A(2A) antagonists are extremely useful for pharmacotherapy of L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease patients.
