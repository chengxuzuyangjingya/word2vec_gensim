Limits and drawbacks of video-assisted parathyroidectomy.	Minimally invasive video-assisted parathyroidectomy (MIVAP) is a novel minimally invasive approach to primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). It is a gasless operation characterized by a single central incision and external retraction. This paper describes the drawbacks and limitations of this procedure based on a 5-year experience and 260 operations.
High-tech methods in pediatric surgery]	Scientific and technical progress resulting in the introduction of high technologies in medicine radically changed the concept of surgical treatment of children. It is currently based on low-traumatic and minimally invasive methods for surgical intervention. High-tech surgical interventions implies the availability of modern sophisticated equipment and adequate anesthesiological support with comprehensive intraoperative monitoring all vitally important parameters. In the postoperative period, part of the patients need adequate (sometimes long-term) parenteral feeding with the application of long-term Broviak catheters and Space B-Braun systems. The use of this equipment in our Centre makes possible surgical treatment of children at a qualitatively new (low-traumatic and minimally invasive) level and reduce the duration of surgery by 50% compared with traditional methods.
