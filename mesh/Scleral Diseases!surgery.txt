Sclerokeratoplasty with maintenance of the angle.	Using sclerocorneal dissection and angle-support sutures to maintain the angle and its function, we performed 14-mm sclerokeratoplasty with placement of allograft tissue in five eyes of 15 patients. One previously operated-on eye required a second sclerokeratoplasty and three eyes required secondary optical keratoplasty after opacification of the original large graft. Patients were monitored from 11 to 90 months postoperatively. At the last examination, all patients had clear grafts and visual acuity had improved since the preoperative examination. All patients had intraocular pressure maintained within normal range (less than 22 mm Hg, as measured by pneumotonometry) except for two patients in whom transient increases were resolved by tapering of corticosteroid treatment. Our results suggested that sclerokeratoplasty, using angle-support sutures, is an effective treatment for diffuse destructive corneoscleral disease that cannot be managed with a smaller graft.
Modified bare sclera method for the treatment of primary pterygium: a preliminary report.	The bare sclera technique is still in use by many surgeons worldwide in spite of the attendant high recurrence rate. Any modification of this well known procedure may be more widely acceptable if associated with lower recurrence.
Ahmed glaucoma valve surgery for necrotizing scleritis with secondary glaucoma.	To report the challenges in management in a case of scleritis with extensive staphylomas with secondary glaucoma. A 35-year-old one eyed female, a known case of scleromalacia perforans, presented with raised intraocular pressure on maximum medical treatment. She underwent successful Ahmed glaucoma valve surgery with exposure of the implant following a repeat episode of necrotizing scleritis after 3 months. Management of eyes with scleritis and secondary glaucoma can be challenging with unexpected complications and postoperative course.
