Splenic hemangioma with thrombocytopenia in a newborn.	The case report of a newborn infant with a splenic hemangioendothelioma with the life-threatening complications of thrombocytopenia, anemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation is presented together with a review of the literature. Removal of the tumor via splenectomy, despite the known risk of subsequent overwhelming sepsis due to encapsulated organisms in the young child, is the treatment of choice for splenic hemangiomas complicated by thrombocytopenia. The use of enhanced CT with delayed filling is a diagnostic tool in the workup of suspected hemangiomatous lesions.
