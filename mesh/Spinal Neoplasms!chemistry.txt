Carcinoid tumor of the coccyx: case report and review of the literature.	Report of a patient with a carcinoid tumor of the coccyx.
Primary cardiac pleomorphic sarcoma presenting as back pain in an 18-year-old man.	Soft-tissue sarcoma is the most prevalent primary malignant cardiac tumor. This sarcoma usually presents with cardiac manifestations secondary to local obstruction or arrhythmias; very rarely does it present with initial symptoms of distant metastasis. We discuss the unusual case of an 18-year-old man who emergently presented with acute-on-chronic back pain. Imaging revealed a lesion on the 12th thoracic vertebra and a large mass arising from the left atrium. The cardiac mass was resected, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed it to be a pleomorphic sarcoma that had metastasized to the spine. The patient died 2 years later of diffuse metastases. In addition to the patient's case, we discuss the nature and treatment of cardiac sarcoma. 
Primary intraosseous malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor: a case report and review of the literature.	Primary intraosseous malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are exceptionally rare; the case reported here represents the first documented example occurring in the spinal column. The tumor arose in the second cervical vertebra of a forty year old woman of Asian origin. She had no stigmata of von Recklinghausen's disease (VRD). Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging showed an osteolytic lesion within the expanded body of the vertebra. Histology revealed spindle-shaped tumor cells with nuclei showing pleomorphism, pallisading and mitotic activity. The cells stained positively for S-100 protein. The patient underwent stabilisation of the cervical spine and tumor excision as a two-stage procedure. She died of pulmonary metastases one year later. We have reviewed the literature on the pathology of these tumors.
