Disseminated simian varicella virus infection in an irradiated rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta).	We describe correlative clinicopathological/virological findings from a simian varicella virus (SVV)-seronegative monkey that developed disseminated varicella 105 days after gamma-irradiation. Twelve other monkeys in the colony were also irradiated, none of which developed varicella. Before irradiation, sera from the monkey that developed disseminated infection and one asymptomatic monkey were available. Analysis indicated that subclinical reactivation of latent SVV from an asymptomatic irradiated monkey likely led to disseminated varicella in the seronegative irradiated monkey. These findings parallel those from humans with disseminated varicella infection and support the usefulness of SVV infection as a model for human varicella-zoster virus infection, particularly virus reactivation after gamma-irradiation.
