Changes in the drainage system of the eye during hydromonitoring exposure]	A hydromonitoring exposure with a high-velocity pulsed liquid jet aimed into Schlemm's canal lumen and a similar exposure with a syringe at a 60 H pressure on piston were carried out in isolated eyes. Examinations of stained sections showed that hydromonitoring exposure at a pressure of 1 to 5 techn. atm. induced destruction of Schlemm's canal internal wall and cyclodialysis. If a higher pressure was used, corneal stratification was observed. Hydromonitoring exposure at a pressure of less than 1 techn. atm. or an exposure with a syringe induced deformation of Schlemm's canal internal wall, dilatation of intertrabecular fissures, and ruptures of individual trabecular layers.
