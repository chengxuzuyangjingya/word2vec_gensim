Inactivation by ionizing radiation of Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella infantis, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in oysters (Crassostrea brasiliana).	Irradiation is considered one of the most efficient technological processes for the reduction of microorganisms in food. It can be used to improve the safety of food products, and to extend their shelf lives. Oysters are considered one of the most important vehicles for pathogenic bacteria because of their feeding characteristics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of a gamma radiation process on high levels of Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Infantis, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus incorporated by oysters (Crassostrea brasiliana), as well as the effects of the process on the survival of the oysters and on their sensory attributes. The oysters were exposed to gamma radiation (60Co) in doses ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 kGy. A dose of 3.0 kGy was generally sufficient to reduce the level of Salmonella serotypes by 5 to 6 log10 units. A dose of 1.0 kGy was sufficient to produce a 6-log10 reduction in the level of V. parahaemolyticus. The highest irradiation dose did not kill the oysters or affect their sensory attributes. Hence, a dose of 3.0 kGy can be considered effective in inactivating Salmonella and V. parahaemolyticus in oysters without changing their odor, flavor, or appearance.
Decontamination of unpackaged and vacuum-packaged boneless chicken breast with pulsed ultraviolet light.	The effectiveness of pulsed UV light on the microbial load of boneless chicken breast was investigated. Unpackaged and vacuum-packaged samples inoculated with an antibiotic-resistant strain of Salmonella Typhimurium on the top surfaces were treated with pulsed UV light for 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 s at 5, 8, and 13 cm distance from the quartz window in the pulsed UV light chamber. The log(10) reductions of Salmonella (cfu/cm(2)) on unpackaged samples varied from 1.2 to 2.4 after a 5-s treatment at 13 cm and a 60-s treatment at 5 cm, respectively. The log(10) reductions on vacuum-packaged samples varied from 0.8 to 2.4 after the 5-s treatment at 13 cm and the 60-s treatment at 5 cm, respectively. The optimum treatment conditions were determined to be 5 cm-15 s for unpackaged samples and 5 cm-30 s for vacuum-packaged samples, both of which resulted in about 2 log(10) reduction (approximately 99%). The total energy and temperatures of samples increased with longer treatment time and shorter distance from the quartz window in the pulsed UV light chamber. The changes in chemical quality and color of samples were determined after mild (at 13 cm for 5 s), moderate (at 8 cm for 30 s), and extreme (at 5 cm for 60 s) treatments. Neither malonaldehyde contents nor color parameters changed significantly (P > 0.05) after mild and moderate treatments. Mechanical properties of the packaging material were analyzed before and after pulsed UV light treatments. The elastic modulus at both along-machine and perpendicular-to-machine direction and yield strength at perpendicular-to-machine direction changed significantly (P < 0.05) after extreme treatment. Overall, these results clearly indicate that pulsed UV light has a potential to be used for decontamination of unpackaged and vacuum-packaged poultry.
Use of low-dose irradiation to evaluate the radiation sensitivity of Escherichia coli O157:H7, non-O157 verotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Salmonella in phosphate-buffered saline.	Verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) and Salmonella are major foodborne pathogens, but very little information is available on the radiation resistance of a sufficiently diverse group of these pathogens. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of E. coli O157:H7, non-O157 VTEC, and Salmonella to a low-dose ionizing radiation treatment. Test organisms were 6 serovars of Salmonella, 5 strains of E. coli O157:H7, and 27 strains of non-O157 VTEC (representing 19 serotypes). Decimal reduction doses (D-values) for individual strains were determined in phosphate-buffered saline using an X-ray source. The viability of the bacterial cells declined with an increase in absorbed dose from 0 to 0.3 kGy. The more resistant test strains were screened at 0.5 and 0.7 kGy. All six Salmonella strains survived at 0.5 and 0.7 kGy; however, only 11 VTEC survived at 0.7 kGy. After the 0.3-kGy treatment, both E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 VTEC had D-values with similar means and ranges (0.028 to 0.123 and 0.037 to 0.127 kGy, respectively), with no significant differences (P > 0.05). Salmonella strains had a slightly higher range of D-values (0.061 to 0.147 kGy) and a mean D-value that was significantly higher (P > 0.05) than that of both the E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 VTEC groups.
