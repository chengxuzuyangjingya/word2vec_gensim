Biochemical and immunologic comparison of virus-like particles for a rotavirus subunit vaccine.	A parenterally administered rotavirus vaccine composed of virus-like particles (VLPs) is being evaluated for human use. VLPs composed of bovine VP6 and simian VP7 (SA11, G3) proteins (6/7-VLPs) or of bovine VP2, bovine VP6, and simian VP7 (SA11, G3) proteins (2/6/7-VLPs) were synthesized and purified from Sf9 insect cells co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses. 6/7- and 2/6/7-VLP administered parenterally (i.m.) in mice had comparable immunogenicity, but the 2/6/7-VLPs were more homogeneous and stable. The inclusion of the VP2 capsid contributed to particle formation and stability. The adjuvant QS-21 significantly enhanced the immunogenicity of 2/6/7-VLPs over A10H or saline alone. Equivalent serum neutralizing antibody responses were induced over the range of 1-15 microg/dose of 2/6/7-VLPs administered with the range of 5-20 microg/dose of QS-21. The immunogenicity of 2/6/7-VLPs and inactivated SA11 virus were comparable. 2/6/7-VLPs are a promising candidate for a parenterally delivered rotavirus subunit vaccine.
The pattern of tegument-capsid interaction in the herpes simplex virus type 1 virion is not influenced by the small hexon-associated protein VP26.	Examination of the three-dimensional structure of intact herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) virions had revealed that the icosahedrally symmetrical interaction between the tegument and capsid involves the pentons but not the hexons (Z. H. Zhou, D. H. Chen, J. Jakana, F. J. Rixon, and W. Chiu, J. Virol. 73:3210-3218, 1999). To account for this, we postulated that the presence of the small capsid protein, VP26, on top of the hexons was masking potential binding sites and preventing tegument attachment. We have now tested this hypothesis by determining the structure of virions lacking VP26. Apart from the obvious absence of VP26 from the capsids, the structures of the VP26 minus and wild-type virions were essentially identical. Notably, they showed the same tegument attachment patterns, thereby demonstrating that VP26 is not responsible for the divergent tegument binding properties of pentons and hexons.
A minor capsid protein P30 is essential for bacteriophage PRD1 capsid assembly.	Bacteriophage PRD1 is a double-stranded DNA virus infecting Gram-negative hosts. It has a membrane component located in the interior of the isometric capsid. In addition to the major capsid protein P3, the capsid contains a 9 kDa protein P30. Protein P30 is proposed to be located between the adjacent facets of the icosahedral capsid and is required for stable capsid assembly. In its absence, an empty phage-specific membrane vesicle is formed. The major protein component of this vesicle is a phage-encoded assembly factor, protein P10, that is not present in the final structure.
Hepatitis B viral polymerase fusion proteins are biologically active and can interact with the hepatitis C virus core protein in vivo.	Hepadnaviruses and retroviruses are evolutionarily related families because they both require a process of reverse transcription for genome replication. However, hepadnaviruses produce polymerase (pol) and core proteins separately, while retroviruses synthesize a gag-pol fusion protein that is subsequently cleaved by a virally encoded protease to release a functional polymerase. To test whether an additional sequence at the N-terminus of pol in hepatitis B virus (HBV) interferes with its function, we created two plasmids expressing core-pol fusion proteins, core144-pol and core31-pol. Secreted particles obtained from HuH-7 cells, which were cotransfected with a core-pol fusion protein-expressing plasmid and a core-expressing plasmid, showed a positive signal of HBV DNA by the endogenous polymerase assay, indicating that the core-pol fusion proteins retain DNA priming, polymerization and RNase H activities. The fusion protein was detected in the cytoplasm of transfected cells and in secreted virions by immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, we found by immunofluorescence staining that the HBV core-pol fusion protein colocalized with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein in cytoplasm and in lipid droplets. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that the anti-HCV core complex contained the HBV core-pol fusion protein while the anti-HBV pol complex contained the HCV core protein, which supports the hypothesis that the HCV core protein can form a complex with the HBV core-pol fusion protein.
Organization of two transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus membrane protein topologies within the virion and core.	The difference in membrane (M) protein compositions between the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) virion and the core has been studied. The TGEV M protein adopts two topologies in the virus envelope, a Nexo-Cendo topology (with the amino terminus exposed to the virus surface and the carboxy terminus inside the virus particle) and a Nexo-Cexo topology (with both the amino and carboxy termini exposed to the virion surface). The existence of a population of M molecules adopting a Nexo-Cexo topology in the virion envelope was demonstrated by (i) immunopurification of (35)S-labeled TGEV virions using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the M protein carboxy terminus (this immunopurification was inhibited only by deletion mutant M proteins that maintained an intact carboxy terminus), (ii) direct binding of M-specific MAbs to the virus surface, and (iii) mass spectrometry analysis of peptides released from trypsin-treated virions. Two-thirds of the total number of M protein molecules found in the virion were associated with the cores, and one-third was lost during core purification. MAbs specific for the M protein carboxy terminus were bound to native virions through the M protein in a Nexo-Cexo conformation, and these molecules were removed when the virus envelope was disrupted with NP-40 during virus core purification. All of the M protein was susceptible to N-glycosidase F treatment of the native virions, which indicates that all the M protein molecules are exposed to the virus surface. Cores purified from glycosidase-treated virions included M protein molecules that completely or partially lost the carbohydrate moiety, which strongly suggests that the M protein found in the cores was also exposed in the virus envelope and was not present exclusively in the virus interior. A TGEV virion structure integrating all the data is proposed. According to this working model, the TGEV virion consists of an internal core, made of the nucleocapsid and the carboxy terminus of the M protein, and the envelope, containing the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, and the M protein in two conformations. The two-thirds of the molecules that are in a Nexo-Cendo conformation (with their carboxy termini embedded within the virus core) interact with the internal core, and the remaining third of the molecules, whose carboxy termini are in a Nexo-Cexo conformation, are lost during virus core purification.
Glycoprotein K specified by herpes simplex virus type 1 is expressed on virions as a Golgi complex-dependent glycosylated species and functions in virion entry.	To facilitate detection of glycoprotein K (gK) specified by herpes simplex virus, a 12-amino-acid epitope tag was inserted within gK domain III. Recombinant virus gKprotC-DIII, expressing the tagged gK, was isolated. This virus formed wild-type plaques and replicated as efficiently as the wild-type KOS virus in Vero cells. Anti-protein C MAb detected high-mannose and Golgi complex-dependent glycosylated gK within cells as well as on purified virions. The gK-null virus DeltagK (gK(-/-)) entered Vero cells substantially more slowly than the wild-type KOS (gK(+/+)), while DeltagK virus grown in complementing VK302 cells (gK(-/+)) entered with entry kinetics similar to those of the KOS virus.
Antibody-mediated targeting of replication-competent retroviral vectors.	Replication-competent murine leukemia virus (MLV) vectors can be engineered to achieve high efficiency gene transfer to solid tumors in vivo and tumor-restricted replication, however their safety can be further enhanced by redirecting tropism of the virus envelope. We have therefore tested the targeting capability and replicative stability of ecotropic and amphotropic replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) vectors containing two tandem repeats from the immunoglobulin G-binding domain of Staphylococcal protein A inserted into the proline-rich "hinge" region of the envelope, which enables modular use of antibodies of various specificities for vector targeting. The modified envelopes were efficiently expressed and incorporated into virions, were capable of capturing monoclonal anti-HER2 antibodies, and mediated efficient binding of the virus-antibody complex to HER2-positive target cells. While infectivity was markedly reduced by pseudotyping with targeted envelopes alone, coexpression of wild-type envelope rescued efficient cellular entry. Both ecotropic and amphotropic RCR vector/anti-HER2 antibody complexes achieved significant enhancement of transduction on murine target cells overexpressing HER2, which could be competed by preincubation with excess free antibodies. Interestingly, HER2-expressing human breast cancer cells did not show enhancement of transduction despite efficient antibody-mediated cell surface binding, suggesting that target cell-specific parameters markedly affect the efficiency of post-binding entry processes. Serial replication of targeted vectors resulted in selection of Z domain deletion variants, but reduction of the overall size of the vector genome enhanced its stability. Application of antibody-mediated targeting to the initial localization of replication-competent virus vectors to tumor sites will thus require optimized target selection and vector design.
Self-organization: making complex infectious viral particles from purified precursors.	Viruses have served as excellent model systems in which to study biological self-organization. Purified virion structural constituents have been shown to self-assemble into particles that can initiate a productive infection in the host cell resulting in the release of progeny virions. Accumulating information on virus structures and assembly principles has revealed unexpected similarities between viruses that infect hosts as diverse as bacteria and humans, suggesting that these viruses had an early common ancestor. I will describe, in more detail, the assembly pathway of a complex double-stranded RNA bacterial virus. In this system, infectious viral particles are produced starting from purified protein and nucleic acid constituents through an elaborate self-assembly, RNA-packaging and synthesis pathway.
Use of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase recovered from human plasma for phenotypic drug susceptibility testing.	To demonstrate the use of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) recovered directly from plasma for phenotypic drug susceptibility testing.
Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of immunogenic virus-like particles formed by infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) structural protein VP2.	Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) causes a highly contagious disease in young chicks and leads to significant economic losses in the poultry industry. VP2 protein, which consists of 452 amino-acid residues, is the primary immunogen of IBDV and contains the epitopes responsible for eliciting neutralizing antibodies. When the chimeric VP2 protein (rVP2H) of a local IBDV strain P3009 was expressed alone using the baculovirus system, virus-like particles of approximately 23 nm in diameter formed spontaneously. Highly pure rVP2H particles, obtained using ammonium sulfate precipitation, immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography, were successfully crystallized using the vapour-diffusion method. These crystals, with a maximum dimension of 0.4 mm, diffracted X-rays to 4.5 A resolution, but data were only collected to 6 A. Preliminary analysis of the diffraction data showed that the rVP2H crystals belong to the cubic space group P2(1)3, with unit-cell parameter 323.1 A. The icosahedral symmetry of the particles is clearly seen in the self-rotation function maps, with dyads and triads coincident with the crystallographic axes. Each asymmetric unit contains 1/3 of the particle, or 20 rVP2H subunits, and there are four particles in a unit cell, probably in a tetrahedral arrangement.
Digestion pattern of reovirus outer capsid protein sigma3 determined by mass spectrometry.	Reovirus is an enteric virus comprising eight structural proteins that form a double-layered capsid. During reovirus entry into cells, the outermost capsid layer (composed of proteins sigma3 and mu1C) is proteolytically processed to generate an infectious subviral particle (ISVP) that is subsequently uncoated to produce the transcriptionally active core particle. Kinetic studies suggest that protein sigma3 is rapidly removed from virus particles and then protein mu1C is cleaved. Initial cleavage of mu1C has been well described and generates an amino (N)-terminal delta peptide and a carboxyl (C)-terminal phi peptide. However, cleavage and removal of sigma3 is an extremely rapid event that has not been well defined. We have treated purified reovirus serotype 1 Lang virions with a variety of endoproteases. Time-course digestions with chymotrypsin, Glu-C, pepsin, and trypsin resulted in the initial generation of two peptides that were resolved in SDS-PAGE and analyzed by in-gel tryptic digestion and MALDI-Qq-TOFMS. Most tested proteases cut sigma3 within a "hypersensitive" region between amino acids 217 and 238. In addition, to gain a better understanding of the sequence of subsequent proteolytic events that result in generation of reovirus subviral particles, time-course digestions of purified particles were performed under physiologic salt conditions and released peptide fragments ranging from 500 to 5000 Da were directly analyzed by MALDI-Qq-TOFMS. Trypsin digestion initially released a peptide that corresponded to the C-terminus of mu1C, followed by a peptide that corresponded to amino acids 214-236 of the sigma3 protein. Other regions of mu1C were not observed until protein sigma3 was completely digested. Similar experiments with Glu-C indicated the hypersensitive region of sigma3 was cut first when virions were treated at pH values of 4.5 or 7.4, but treatment of virions with pepsin at pH 3.0 released different sigma3 peptides, suggesting acid-induced conformational changes in this outer capsid protein. These studies also revealed that the N-terminus of sigma3 is acetylated.
Downregulation of CD4 is required for maintenance of viral infectivity of HIV-1.	Downregulation of virus receptors on the cell surface is considered to be important in preventing superinfection. HIV-1 encodes multiple gene products, Env, Vpu, and Nef, involved in downregulation of CD4, a major HIV-1 receptor. We found that simultaneous mutations in both vpu and nef severely impaired virus replication. We examined the involvement of CD4 downregulation mediated by Vpu and Nef in the modification of virus infectivity. The mutation in vpu increased CD4 incorporation into virions without affecting the Env content in it, inhibiting the attachment step of virions to the CD4-positive cell surface. Although a single mutation in nef suppresses virus infectivity via a CD4-independent mechanism, it could augment CD4 incorporation in virions in combination with a vpu mutation. These results indicated that CD4 downregulation was necessary for maintenance of Env function in the virion.
Cholesterol depletion of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and simian immunodeficiency virus with beta-cyclodextrin inactivates and permeabilizes the virions: evidence for virion-associated lipid rafts.	Recent evidence suggests that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles assemble and bud selectively through areas in the plasma membrane of cells that are highly enriched with glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and cholesterol, called lipid rafts. Since cholesterol is required to maintain lipid raft structure and function, we proposed that virion-associated cholesterol removal with the compound 2-hydroxy-propyl-beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) might be disruptive to HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We examined the effect of beta-CD on the structure and infectivity of cell-free virions. We found that beta-CD inactivated HIV-1 and SIV in a dose-dependent manner and permeabilized the viral membranes, resulting in the loss of mature Gag proteins (capsid, matrix, nucleocapsid, p1, and p6) without loss of the envelope glycoproteins. SIV also lost reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN), and viral RNA. IN appeared to be only slightly diminished in HIV-1, and viral RNA, RT, matrix, and nucleocapsid proteins were retained in HIV-1 but to a much lesser degree. Host proteins located internally in the virus (actin, moesin, and ezrin) and membrane-associated host proteins (major histocompatibility complex classes I and II) remained associated with the treated virions. Electron microscopy revealed that under conditions that permeabilized the viruses, holes were present in the viral membranes and the viral core structure was perturbed. These data provide evidence that an intact viral membrane is required to maintain mature virion core integrity. Since the viruses were not fixed before beta-CD treatment and intact virion particles were recovered, the data suggest that virions may possess a protein scaffold that can maintain overall structure despite disruptions in membrane integrity.
The herpes simplex virus 1 RNA binding protein US11 is a virion component and associates with ribosomal 60S subunits.	The herpes simplex virus 1 US11 gene encodes a site- and conformation-specific RNA binding regulatory protein. We fused the coding sequence of this protein with that of beta-galactosidase, expressed the chimeric gene in Escherichia coli, and purified a fusion protein which binds RNA in the same way as the infected cell protein. The fusion protein was used to generate anti-US11 monoclonal antibody. Studies with this antibody showed that US11 protein is a viral structural protein estimated to be present in 600 to 1,000 copies per virion. The great majority of cytoplasmic US11 protein was found in association with the 60S subunit of infected cell ribosomes. US11 protein associates with ribosomes both late in infection at the time of its synthesis and at the time of infection after its introduction into the cytoplasm by the virion. US11 protein expressed in an uninfected cell line stably transfected with the US11 gene associates with ribosomal 60S subunits and localizes to nucleoli, suggesting that US11 protein requires no other viral functions for these associations.
TGEV corona virus ORF4 encodes a membrane protein that is incorporated into virions.	The coding potential of the open reading frame ORF4 (82 amino acids) of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been confirmed by expression using a baculovirus vector. Five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the 10K recombinant product immunoprecipitated a polypeptide of a similar size in TGEV-infected cells. Immunofluorescence assays performed both on insect and mammalian cells revealed that ORF4 was a membrane-associated protein, a finding consistent with the prediction of a membrane-spanning segment in ORF4 sequence. Two epitopes were localized within the last 21 C-terminal residues of the sequence through peptide scanning and analysis of the reactivity of a truncated ORF4 recombinant protein. Since the relevant MAbs were found to induce a cell surface fluorescence, these data suggest that ORF4 may be an integral membrane protein having a Cexo-Nendo orientation. Anti-ORF4 MAbs were also used to show that ORF4 polypeptide may be detected in TGEV virion preparations, with an estimated number of 20 molecules incorporated per particle. Comparison of amino acid sequence data provided strong evidence that other coronaviruses encode a polypeptide homologous to TGEV ORF4. Our results led us to propose that ORF4 represents a novel minor structural polypeptide, tentatively designated SM (small membrane protein).
Simian varicella virus: characterization of virion and infected cell polypeptides and the antigenic cross-reactivity with varicella-zoster virus.	Simian varicella virus (SVV) causes a varicella-like disease in non-human primates. In this study, SVV virions were purified from SVV-infected BSC-1 cells by zonal and differential gradient centrifugation and the virion polypeptide composition was analysed by SDS-PAGE. SVV virions had a buoyant density of 1.21 g/ml, identical to the value obtained for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) virions purified by the same method. Electron microscopy of the concentrated SVV virions revealed characteristic herpesvirus morphology. SVV virions consisted of at least 30 polypeptide species ranging from 16K to greater than 200K. The electrophoretic profiles of radiolabelled SVV and VZV virion polypeptides were very similar. Immunoprecipitations of solubilized SVV-infected cell preparations using SVV immune sera revealed at least 18 viral polypeptides with an Mr range of 12K to 142K and six glycoproteins ranging from 46K to 115K. In addition, extensive cross-reactivity between SVV and VZV proteins and glycoproteins was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation with heterologous immune sera. The high degree of antigenic relatedness between SVV and VZV provides further support for simian varicella as a model for VZV infections.
Mutation in the primer binding site of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus genome affects virus production and infectivity.	In an effort to understand the contribution of the primer-binding site (PBS) region to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication, we have constructed a mutant HIV proviral DNA with an alteration in the 5' end of the PBS. The PBS mutant proviral DNA was characterized by transfection of the viral DNA into CD4+ and non-CD4+ target cells. The results indicate that mutation in the PBS reduced the level of viral particles released into the medium of transfected cells in comparison to wild-type proviral DNA. The viral particles were noninfectious upon transmission to established CD4+ cell lines and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Electron microscopic analysis of the transfected cells revealed no abnormalities in the structure of the virion directed by the mutant proviral DNA. Also, the protein and RNA contents of the mutant virions were similar to the wild type. The quantitation of intracellular viral structural protein in the transfected cells, however, indicated that the PBS mutation may have an effect on the assembly of viral particles in addition to completely abolishing reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA. These results provide evidence that the PBS region of the viral genome has multiple functions in HIV-1 replication.
Conformational alteration of Sindbis virion glycoproteins induced by heat, reducing agents, or low pH.	Sindbis virions undergo a conformational rearrangement after attachment to cells but prior to entry, as detected by exposure of epitopes on virus-cell complexes which are not accessible to their cognate monoclonal antibodies on native virions (D. C. Flynn, W. J. Meyer, and R. E. Johnston, J. Virol. 64:3643-3653, 1990). The rearrangement did not appear to require transit of virions through a low-pH environment, and the altered virions participated in a productive infection. This naturally occurring structural alteration could be mimicked, although not precisely duplicated, by any of the three artificial treatments of purified virions in vitro: brief incubation at 51 degrees C, treatment with 1 to 5 mM dithiothreitol, or incubation of pH 5.8 to 6.0. Infectivity was maintained after all three treatments, suggesting that Sindbis virions are metastable and can exist in at least two infectious conformations. The integrity of external, neutralizing epitopes was maintained on cell-associated virions and in the altered conformations induced by heat and dithiothreitol, whereas these epitopes were unreactive under low-pH conditions that induced an analogous exposure of previously inaccessible epitopes. The pH at which the conformational change was induced and the pH at which virions could mediate cell-cell fusion from without were coordinately shifted when these two parameters were determined for another strain of Sindbis virus. This coordinate shift in pH optima suggests that the conformational change in virion structure observed at the cell surface may be causally related to fusion.
Viral RNAs detected in virions of porcine adenovirus type 3.	It has been demonstrated that cellular and viral RNAs were packaged in the virions of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV 1), members of the Herpesviridae family, both of which are enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses. Here, we provide evidence suggesting that RNAs are packaged in the virions of porcine adenovirus type 3 (PAdV-3), which is a member of the Adenoviridae family, a non-enveloped double-stranded DNA virus. The RNAs packaged in PAdV-3 virions were enriched in the size range of 300-1000 bases long. By reverse transcription (RT) of RNAs isolated from purified PAdV-3 virions, PCR amplification, and DNA sequence analysis of PCR products, we determined the identities of some viral RNAs contained in PAdV-3 virions. The results indicated that the RNAs representing transcripts from E1A, E1B, DNA binding protein (DBP), DNA polymerase (POL), E4 and some of the late genes including pIIIA, pIII, pV, Hexon, 33 K, and fiber were detected from purified PAdV-3 virions. In contrast, we could not detect the RNAs representing transcripts of precursor terminal protein (pTP), 52 kDa, pX, or 100-kDa protein genes in purified virions. Because the transcripts of pIX, IVa2, E3, protease, pVI, pVII, and pVIII overlap with those of other genes in PAdV-3, we could not definitely conclude that RNAs representing these transcripts were packaged in virions although the expected DNA fragments were produced by RT-PCR in the RNAs isolated from purified virions.
TYSON: robust searching, sorting, and selecting of single particles in electron micrographs.	We here present TYSON, a new program for automatic and semi-automatic particle selection from electron micrographs. TYSON employs a three-step strategy of searching, sorting and selecting single particles. In the first step, TYSON finds the positions of potential particles by one of three different methods: local averaging, template matching or local variance. The practical merits and drawbacks of these methods are discussed. In the second step, these potential particles are automatically sorted according to their probability of being true positives. Many criteria are provided for this sort. In the final -interactive- step, whole categories of poorly fitting false positives can be removed with a single mouse-click. We present results obtained using cryo-EM micrographs of both spherical virus particles and asymmetric particles. The procedures are fast and use of TYSON allowed, for example, some 20,000 particles to be selected in a single working day.
Image segmentation for automatic particle identification in electron micrographs based on hidden Markov random field models and expectation maximization.	Three-dimensional reconstruction of large macromolecules like viruses at resolutions below 10 A requires a large set of projection images. Several automatic and semi-automatic particle detection algorithms have been developed along the years. Here we present a general technique designed to automatically identify the projection images of particles. The method is based on Markov random field modelling of the projected images and involves a pre-processing of electron micrographs followed by image segmentation and post-processing. The image is modelled as a coupling of two fields--a Markovian and a non-Markovian. The Markovian field represents the segmented image. The micrograph is the non-Markovian field. The image segmentation step involves an estimation of coupling parameters and the maximum á posteriori estimate of the realization of the Markovian field i.e, segmented image. Unlike most current methods, no bootstrapping with an initial selection of particles is required.
Overcoming antigen masking of anti-amyloidbeta antibodies reveals breaking of B cell tolerance by virus-like particles in amyloidbeta immunized amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice.	In prior work we detected reduced anti-Abeta antibody titers in Abeta-vaccinated transgenic mice expressing the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) compared to nontransgenic littermates. We investigated this observation further by vaccinating APP and nontransgenic mice with either the wild-type human Abeta peptide, an Abeta peptide containing the "Dutch Mutation", E22Q, or a wild-type Abeta peptide conjugated to papillomavirus virus-like particles (VLPs).
Detection of RNA in purified cytomegalovirus virions.	Five viral RNA transcripts have recently been detected in purified virions of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strain AD169, a well-characterized member of the family Herpesviridae [Science 288 (2000) 2373]. While the function of these transcripts and/or the proteins they encode remains to be elucidated, it is not known whether these transcripts are unique to strain AD169 or are present in other HCMV strains. The objective of this study was to determine if these RNAs are present in other HCMV laboratory strains (Towne and Davis), and a low passage clinical isolate (CL203). These strains of CMV were purified by sequential ultracentrifugation through 20% D-sorbitol and glycerol-potassium tartarate gradients and the morphology and infectivity of the virions confirmed by electron microscopy and inoculation into cell culture. When RNA extracted from the purified virions was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) the UL 21.5 and TRL/IRL 2-5 transcripts were detected in virions of HCMV strains AD169, Davis, Towne and CL203. The presence of the UL 21.5 and TRL/IRL 2-5 RNA transcripts in all strains tested demonstrates that the packaged transcripts occurs in all strains of HCMV suggesting that they may have a relevant role in the biology of this virus.
Molecular mechanism of paramyxovirus budding.	Components of paramyxoviruses are assembled at the plasma membrane of infected cells, and progeny viruses are formed by the budding process. Although the molecular mechanisms that drive budding (membrane curving and "pinching-off" reaction) are not well understood, the viral matrix (M) protein is thought to play a major role in the process. The M protein forms a dense layer tightly associated with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of infected cells. Expression of the M protein of some paramyxoviruses results in the formation and release of virus-like particles that contain the M protein; thus, in these viruses, the M protein alone can apparently trigger all steps required for the formation and release of virus-like particles. M also interacts specifically with viral envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsids and is involved in directed transport of viral components to the budding site at the apical surface of polarized cells. In addition, protein-protein interactions between M and the cytoplasmic tail of viral glycoproteins and between M and the nucleocapsid affect the efficiency of virus production. The structural organization of the virion and the functions of the M protein clearly indicate that this protein orchestrates the budding of paramyxovirus.
Virion proteins of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.	The proteins that compose a herpesvirus virion are thought to contain the functional information required for de novo infection, as well as virion assembly and egress. To investigate functional roles of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) virion proteins in viral productive replication and de novo infection, we attempted to identify virion proteins from purified KSHV by a proteomic approach. Extracellular KSHV virions were purified from phorbol-12-tetradecanoate-13-acetate-induced BCBL-1 cells through double-gradient ultracentrifugation, and their component proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Thirty prominent protein bands were excised and subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography ion trap mass spectrometric analysis. This study led to the identification of 24 virion-associated proteins. These include five capsid proteins, eight envelope glycoproteins, six tegument proteins, and five proteins whose locations in the virions have not yet been defined. Putative tegument proteins encoded by open reading frame 21 (ORF21), ORF33, and ORF45 were characterized and found to be resistant to protease digestion when purified virions were treated with trypsin, confirming that they are located within the virion particles. The ORF64-encoded large tegument protein was found to be associated with capsid but sensitive to protease treatment, suggesting its unique structure and array in KSHV virions. In addition, cellular beta-actin and class II myosin heavy chain type A were found inside KSHV virions and associated with tegument-capsid structure. Identification of KSHV virion proteins makes it possible to study the functional roles of these virion proteins in KSHV replication and pathogenicity.
Analysis of the quaternary structure of the putative HCMV portal protein PUL104.	In this report we analyze the UL104 open reading frame of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome that encodes the putative portal protein. An affinity-purified monospecific antiserum directed against a GST-UL104 fusion protein identified proteins of approximate M(r) 73000 and 145000 in HCMV-infected cells and purified virions. Furthermore, using an in vitro assay the ability of pUL104 to bind double-stranded DNA was shown. Analysis under native conditions of pUL104 revealed that the monomeric and dimeric forms of the protein also form high molecular weight complexes upon sucrose gradient centrifugation. The protein has been purified from recombinant baculovirus UL104 infected cells. The quaternary structure of rpUL104 was investigated by gel permeation chromatography and electron microscopy. The purified rpUL104 was found to assemble into high molecular weight complexes, a prerequisite of portal proteins which form channels for DNA import into capsids.
Atomic force microscopy investigation of isolated virions of murine leukemia virus.	Virions of mouse leukemia virus spread on glass substrates were visualized by atomic force microscopy. The size distribution mode was 145 nm, significantly larger than that for human immunodeficiency virus particles. The distribution of particle sizes is broad, indicating that no two particles are likely identical in content or surface features. Virions possess knoblike protrusions, which may represent vestiges of budding from cell membranes. Particles which split open allowed imaging of intact cores with diameters of 65 nm. They also permitted estimation of viral shell thickness (35 to 40 nm) and showed the presence of a distinct trough between the shell and the core surface.
Folding and particle assembly are disrupted by single-point mutations near the autocatalytic cleavage site of Nudaurelia capensis omega virus capsid protein.	Protein subunits of several RNA viruses are known to undergo post-assembly, autocatalytic cleavage that is required for infectivity. Nudaurelia capensis omega virus (Nomega V) is one of the simplest viruses to undergo an autocatalytic cleavage, making it an excellent model to understand both assembly and the mechanism of autoproteolysis. Heterologous expression of the coat protein gene of Nomega V in a baculovirus system results in the spontaneous assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) that remain uncleaved when purified at neutral pH. After acidification to pH 5.0, the VLPs autocatalytically cleave at residue 570, providing an in vitro control of the cleavage. The crystal structure of Nomega V displays three residues near the scissile bond that were candidates for participation in the reaction. These were changed by site-directed mutagenesis to conservative and nonconservative residues and the products analyzed. Even conservative changes at the three residues dramatically reduced cleavage when the subunits assembled properly. Unexpectedly, we discovered that these residues are not only critical to the kinetics of Nomega V autoproteolysis, but are also necessary for proper folding of subunits and, ultimately, assembly of Nomega V VLPs.
Structure of the mature P3-virus particle complex of cauliflower mosaic virus revealed by cryo-electron microscopy.	The cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) has an icosahedral capsid composed of the viral protein P4. The viral product P3 is a multifunctional protein closely associated with the virus particle within host cells. The best-characterized function of P3 is its implication in CaMV plant-to-plant transmission by aphid vectors, involving a P3-virion complex. In this transmission process, the viral protein P2 attaches to virion-bound P3, and creates a molecular bridge between the virus and a putative receptor in the aphid's stylets. Recently, the virion-bound P3 has been suggested to participate in cell-to-cell or long-distance movement of CaMV within the host plant. Thus, as new data accumulate, the importance of the P3-virion complex during the virus life-cycle is becoming more and more evident. To provide a first insight into the knowledge of the transmission process of the virus, we determined the 3D structures of native and P3-decorated virions by cryo-electron microscopy and computer image processing. By difference mapping and biochemical analysis, we show that P3 forms a network around the capsomers and we propose a structural model for the binding of P3 to CaMV capsid in which its C terminus is anchored deeply in the inner shell of the virion, while the N-terminal extremity is facing out of the CaMV capsid, forming dimers by coiled-coil interactions. Our results combined with existing data reinforce the hypothesis that this coiled-coil N-terminal region of P3 could coordinate several functions during the virus life-cycle, such as cell-to-cell movement and aphid-transmission.
Recombinant virus like particles as drug delivery system.	The drug delivery system described here is based on a virus like particle consisting of the recombinant expressed major capsid protein of Polyomavirus, VP1. Polyoma, a murine virus belonging to the Papovaviridae, forms a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid. These capsids are organized as a double shell composed of three different proteins: VP1,VP2 and VP3. The outer shell of the vision is composed of 360 VP1 molecules arranged as 72 pentamers. These capsids have a diameter of about 50 nm. The VP1 protein acts as a major ligand for certain membrane receptors during virus infection. Furthermore, the N-terminus of the VP1 protein contains a DNA-binding domain and a nuclear localization sequence. The recombinant production of the VP1 protein offers a save way to obtain a highly purified, non pathogenic pharmaceutical excipient. Combining these aspects, VP1 proteins provide a targeting as well as a drug binding site when used as a save drug carrier for gene therapy. Current applications are also including oligonucleotides as well as small molecules as well as vaccines.
Structure of an unliganded simian immunodeficiency virus gp120 core.	Envelope glycoproteins of human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV and SIV) undergo a series of conformational changes when they interact with receptor (CD4) and co-receptor on the surface of a potential host cell, leading ultimately to fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Structures of fragments of gp120 and gp41 from the envelope protein are known, in conformations corresponding to their post-attachment and postfusion states, respectively. We report the crystal structure, at 4 A resolution, of a fully glycosylated SIV gp120 core, in a conformation representing its prefusion state, before interaction with CD4. Parts of the protein have a markedly different organization than they do in the CD4-bound state. Comparison of the unliganded and CD4-bound structures leads to a model for events that accompany receptor engagement of an envelope glycoprotein trimer. The two conformations of gp120 also present distinct antigenic surfaces. We identify the binding site for a compound that inhibits viral entry.
Characterization and intracellular localization of the Epstein-Barr virus protein BFLF2: interactions with BFRF1 and with the nuclear lamina.	We have reported in the accompanying paper that the BFRF1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is important for efficient primary viral envelopment and egress (A. Farina, R. Feederle, S. Raffa, R. Gonnella, R. Santarelli, L. Frati, A. Angeloni, M. R. Torrisi, A. Faggioni, and H.-J. Delecluse, J. Virol. 79:3703-3712). Here we describe the characterization of the product of the EBV BFLF2 gene, which belongs to a family of conserved herpesviral genes which include the UL31 genes of herpes simplex virus and of pseudorabies virus and whose products are known to interact with UL34, the positional homolog of BFRF1. BFLF2 is an early transcript and is expressed in a variety of cell lines upon EBV lytic cycle activation. Western blotting of purified virion preparations showed that BFLF2 is a component of intracellular virions but is absent from mature extracellular virions. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that BFLF2 interacts with BFRF1, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showing that the two proteins colocalize on the nuclear membrane not only upon cotransfection in epithelial cells but also during viral replication. In cells carrying an EBV mutant with the BFRF1 gene deleted (293-BFRF1-KO cells) BFLF2 expression was low, and it was restored to wild-type levels upon treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Furthermore, recomplementing the 293-BFRF1-KO cells by BFRF1 transfection restored BFLF2 expression to the wild-type level. In addition, when expressed alone BFLF2 was localized diffusely inside the nucleus, whereas in the presence of BFRF1 the two proteins colocalized at the nuclear rim. Finally, 293 epithelial cells transfected with either protein or cotransfected were analyzed by electron microscopy to investigate potential alterations in the morphology of the nuclear membrane. The ultrastructural analysis revealed that (i) BFRF1 caused duplications of the nuclear membrane, similar to those reported to occur during the course of herpesviral replication, and (ii) while BFLF2 alone did not cause any apparent alteration, coexpression of the two proteins dramatically induced profound convolutions of the duplicated nuclear membrane. Both biochemical and morphological analysis showed association of the BFRF1-BFLF2 complex with a component of the nuclear lamina, lamin B. Taken together, these results and those of the accompanying paper (Farina et al., J. Virol. 79:3703-3712) indicate an important role of BFRF1 and BFLF2 in the early steps of EBV maturation at the nuclear membrane.
Identification of amino acid residues in the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase tryptophan-repeat motif that are required for subunit interaction using infectious virions.	The human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) functions as a heterodimer (p51/p66), which makes disruption of subunit interactions a possible target for antiviral drug design. Our understanding of subunit interface interactions has been limited by the lack of virus-based approaches for studying the heterodimer. Therefore, we developed a novel subunit-specific mutagenesis approach that enables precise molecular analysis of the heterodimer in the context of infectious HIV-1 particles. Here, we analyzed the contributions of amino acid residues comprising the Trp-motif to RT subunit interaction and function. Our results reveal important inter- and intra-subunit interactions of residues in the Trp-motif. A tryptophan cluster in p51 (W398, W402, W406, W414), proximal to the interface, was found to be important for p51/p66 interaction and stability. At the dimer interface, residues W401, Y405 and N363 in p51 and W410 in p66 mediate inter-subunit interactions. The W401 residue is critical for RT dimerization, exerting distinct effects in p51 and p66. Our analysis of the RT heterodimerization enhancing non-nucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), efavirenz, indicates that the effects of drugs on RT dimer stability can be examined in human cells. Thus, we provide the first description of subunit-specific molecular interactions that affect RT heterodimer function and virus infection in vivo. Moreover, with heightened interest in novel RT inhibitors that affect dimerization, we demonstrate the ability to assess the effects of RT inhibitors on subunit interactions in a physiologically relevant context.
The structure of the poliovirus 135S cell entry intermediate at 10-angstrom resolution reveals the location of an externalized polypeptide that binds to membranes.	Poliovirus provides a well-characterized system for understanding how nonenveloped viruses enter and infect cells. Upon binding its receptor, poliovirus undergoes an irreversible conformational change to the 135S cell entry intermediate. This transition involves shifts of the capsid protein beta barrels, accompanied by the externalization of VP4 and the N terminus of VP1. Both polypeptides associate with membranes and are postulated to facilitate entry by forming a translocation pore for the viral RNA. We have calculated cryo-electron microscopic reconstructions of 135S particles that permit accurate placement of the beta barrels, loops, and terminal extensions of the capsid proteins. The reconstructions and resulting models indicate that each N terminus of VP1 exits the capsid though an opening in the interface between VP1 and VP3 at the base of the canyon that surrounds the fivefold axis. Comparison with reconstructions of 135S particles in which the first 31 residues of VP1 were proteolytically removed revealed that the externalized N terminus is located near the tips of propeller-like features surrounding the threefold axes rather than at the fivefold axes, as had been proposed in previous models. These observations have forced a reexamination of current models for the role of the 135S particle in transmembrane pore formation and suggest testable alternatives.
The incorporation of large impurities into virus crystals.	Virus crystals can incorporate a wide range of unusual impurities, not possible for conventional crystals, or even most protein crystals because of the large size of their constituent particles. These impurities include anomalous virions, satellite viruses and biological fibers. Examples of several of these unusual impurities are presented here, along with some of the consequences for the crystal lattices. The high solvent content, the forgiving character of the lattice and the plasticity of the virions allow these incorporations to be possible.
Absorption spectra of viral components of Sendai virus in the wavelength region from 130 to 320 nm.	Using synchrotron radiation as a light source, the absorption spectra of purified viral components of the Sendai virus, i.e. messenger RNA, lipids, spike (envelope) proteins, reconstructed envelopes, core proteins and whole virions, were obtained in the wavelength region 130-320 nm by measuring the transmission of thin films. Viral (messenger) RNA two peaks at 260 and 190 nm, and a large increase below 160 nm. The absorption spectrum of lipids exhibited a broad peak at 190 nm and a very sharp increase below 160 nm. With spike proteins, a slight peak at 280 nm and a shoulder at 230 nm were observed in addition to a sharper peak at 190 nm and a rather slow increasing absorption below 160 nm. Reconstructed envelopes showed the features of a combination of lipids and proteins. The absorption spectra of core proteins and whole virions exhibited similar characteristics to spike proteins. Conventional UV data were also obtained in the wavelength range 210-320 nm with RNA and lipids. The UV and synchrotron radiation data were in good agreement in terms of the mass absorption coefficients. The molecular splitting of spike proteins was also examined. Proteins gave more diffuse reflection than their subunits, causing a reduction in absorption. This was explained by a loss of transparency with increasing molecular weight.
Architecture of the SARS coronavirus prefusion spike.	The emergence in 2003 of a new coronavirus (CoV) responsible for the atypical pneumonia termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was a stark reminder that hitherto unknown viruses have the potential to cross species barriers to become new human pathogens. Here we describe the SARS-CoV 'spike' structure determined by single-particle cryo-EM, along with the docked atomic structures of the receptor-binding domain and prefusion core.
Generation and structural analysis of reactive empty particles derived from an icosahedral virus.	Chemical and genetic modifications on the surface of viral protein cages confer unique properties to the virus particles with potential nano and biotechnological applications. The enclosed space in the interior of the virus particles further increases its versatility as a nanomaterial. In this paper, we report a simple method to generate a high yield of stable cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) empty capsids from their native nucleoprotein counterparts by removing the encapsidated viral genome without compromising the integrity of the protein coat. Biochemical and structural comparison of artificially generated empty particles did not reveal any distinguishable differences from CPMV particles containing viral RNA. Preliminary results on the use of artificially produced empty CPMV capsids as a carrier capsule are described.
Structures of T=1 and T=3 particles of cucumber necrosis virus: evidence of internal scaffolding.	Cucumber necrosis virus (CNV) is a member of the genus Tombusvirus, of which tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) is the type member. The capsid protein for this group of viruses is composed of three major domains: the R domain, which interacts with the RNA genome: the S domain, which forms the tight capsid shell: and the protruding P domain, which extends approximately 40 Angstrom from the surface. Here, we present the cryo-transmission electron microscopy structures of both the T=1 and T=3 capsids to a resolution of approximately 12 Angstrom. The T=3 capsid is essentially identical with that of TBSV, and the T=1 particles are well described by the A subunit pentons from TBSV. Perhaps most notable is the fact that the T=3 particles have an articulated internal structure with two major internal shells, while the internal core of the T=1 particle is essentially disordered. These internal shells of the T=3 capsid agree extremely well in both dimension and character with published neutron-scattering results. This structure, combined with mutagenesis results in the accompanying article, suggests that the R domain forms an internal icosahedral scaffold that may play a role in T=3 capsid assembly. In addition, the N-terminal region has been shown to be involved in chloroplast targeting. Therefore, this region apparently has remarkably diverse functions that may be distributed unevenly among the quasi-equivalent A, B, and C subunits.
From structure of the complex to understanding of the biology.	The most extensive structural information on viruses relates to apparently icosahedral virions and is based on X-ray crystallography and on cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle reconstructions. Both techniques lean heavily on imposing icosahedral symmetry, thereby obscuring any deviation from the assumed symmetry. However, tailed bacteriophages have icosahedral or prolate icosahedral heads that have one obvious unique vertex where the genome can enter for DNA packaging and exit when infecting a host cell. The presence of the tail allows cryo-EM reconstructions in which the special vertex is used to orient the head in a unique manner. Some very large dsDNA icosahedral viruses also develop special vertices thought to be required for infecting host cells. Similarly, preliminary cryo-EM data for the small ssDNA canine parvovirus complexed with receptor suggests that these viruses, previously considered to be accurately icosahedral, might have some asymmetric properties that generate one preferred receptor-binding site on the viral surface. Comparisons are made between rhinoviruses that bind receptor molecules uniformly to all 60 equivalent binding sites, canine parvovirus, which appears to have a preferred receptor-binding site, and bacteriophage T4, which gains major biological advantages on account of its unique vertex and tail organelle.
The human cytomegalovirus virion possesses an activated casein kinase II that allows for the rapid phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB, IkappaBalpha.	We documented that the NF-kappaB signaling pathway was rapidly induced following human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection of human fibroblasts and that this induced NF-kappaB activity promoted efficient transactivation of the major immediate-early promoter (MIEP). Previously, we showed that the major HCMV envelope glycoproteins, gB and gH, initiated this NF-kappaB signaling event. However, we also hypothesized that there were additional mechanisms utilized by the virus to rapidly upregulate NF-kappaB. In this light, we specifically hypothesized that the HCMV virion contained IkappaBalpha kinase activity, allowing for direct phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha following virion entry into infected cells. In vitro kinase assays performed on purified HCMV virion extract identified bona fide IkappaBalpha kinase activity in the virion. The enzyme responsible for this kinase activity was identified as casein kinase II (CKII), a cellular serine-threonine protein kinase. CKII activity was necessary for efficient transactivation of the MIEP and IE gene expression. CKII is generally considered to be a constitutively active kinase. We suggest that this molecular characteristic of CKII represents the biologic rationale for the viral capture and utilization of this kinase early after infection. The packaging of CKII into the HCMV virion identifies that diverse molecular mechanisms are utilized by HCMV for rapid NF-kappaB activation. We propose that HCMV possesses multiple pathways to increase NF-kappaB activity to ensure that the correct temporal regulation of NF-kappaB occurs following infection and that sufficient threshold levels of NF-kappaB are reached in the diverse array of cells, including monocytes and endothelial cells, infected in vivo.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus accessory protein 6 is a virion-associated protein and is released from 6 protein-expressing cells.	Analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SCoV) by either sucrose gradient equilibrium centrifugation or a virus capture assay using an anti-SCoV S protein antibody demonstrated that the SCoV 6 protein, which is one of the accessory proteins of SCoV, was incorporated into virus particles. Coexpression of the SCoV S, M, E, and 6 proteins was sufficient for incorporation of the 6 protein into virus-like particles. Cells transfected with plasmid expressing the 6 protein released SCoV 6 protein; however, infected cells released SCoV 6 protein only in association with SCoV particles.
Viral MRI contrast agents: coordination of Gd by native virions and attachment of Gd complexes by azide-alkyne cycloaddition.	Icosahedral virus particles decorated with a Gd(DOTA) analogue by Cu-mediated azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and/or with Gd(3+) ions by coordination to the viral nucleoprotein show increased T(1) relaxivity relative to free Gd(DOTA) complexes in solution.
Factors that influence VSV-G pseudotyping and transduction efficiency of lentiviral vectors-in vitro and in vivo implications.	Pseudotyping viral vectors with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) enables the transduction of an extensive range of cell types from different species. We have discovered two important parameters of the VSV-G-pseudotyping phenomenon that relate directly to the transduction potential of lentiviral vectors: (1) the glycosylation status of VSV-G, and (2) the quantity of glycoprotein associated with virions. We measured production-cell and virion-associated quantities of two isoform variants of VSV-G, which differ in their glycosylation status, VSV-G1 and VSV-G2, and assessed the impact of this difference on the efficiency of mammalian cell transduction by lentiviral vectors. The glycosylation of VSV-G at N336 allowed greater maximal expression of VSV-G in HEK293T cells, thus facilitating vector pseudotyping. The transduction of primate cell lines was substantially affected (up to 50-fold) by the degree of VSV-G1 or VSV-G2 incorporation, whereas other cell lines, such as D17 (canine), were less sensitive to virion-associated VSV-G1/2 quantities. These data indicate that the minimum required concentration of virion-associated VSV-G differs substantially between cell species/types. The implications of these data with regard to VSV-G-pseudotyped vector production, titration, and use in host-cell restriction studies, are discussed.
Characterization of gene expression on genomic segment 7 of infectious salmon anaemia virus.	Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) virus (ISAV), an important pathogen of fish that causes disease accompanied by high mortality in marine-farmed Atlantic salmon, is the only species in the genus Isavirus, one of the five genera of the Orthomyxoviridae family. The Isavirus genome consists of eight single-stranded RNA species, and the virions have two surface glycoproteins; haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein encoded on segment 6 and fusion (F) protein encoded on segment 5. Based on the initial demonstration of two 5'-coterminal mRNA transcripts by RT-PCR, ISAV genomic segment 7 was suggested to share a similar coding strategy with segment 7 of influenza A virus, encoding two proteins. However, there appears to be confusion as to the protein sizes predicted from the two open reading frames (ORFs) of ISAV segment 7 which has in turn led to confusion of the predicted protein functions. The primary goal of the present work was to clone and express these two ORFs in order to assess whether the predicted protein sizes match those of the expressed proteins so as to clarify the coding assignments, and thereby identify any additional structural proteins of ISAV.
Asymmetric binding of transferrin receptor to parvovirus capsids.	Although many viruses are icosahedral when they initially bind to one or more receptor molecules on the cell surface, such an interaction is asymmetric, probably causing a breakdown in the symmetry and conformation of the original infecting virion in preparation for membrane penetration and release of the viral genome. Cryoelectron microscopy and biochemical analyses show that transferrin receptor, the cellular receptor for canine parvovirus, can bind to only one or a few of the 60 icosahedrally equivalent sites on the virion, indicating that either canine parvovirus has inherent asymmetry or binding of receptor induces asymmetry. The asymmetry of receptor binding to canine parvovirus is reminiscent of the special portal in tailed bacteriophages and some large, icosahedral viruses. Asymmetric interactions of icosahedral viruses with their hosts might be a more common phenomenon than previously thought and may have been obscured by averaging in previous crystallographic and electron microscopic structure determinations.
Structure of the equine arteritis virus nucleocapsid protein reveals a dimer-dimer arrangement.	Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family, which also includes the porcine pathogen PRRSV and is genetically and structurally related to the coronaviruses. EAV is an important equine pathogen that has caused significant economic losses to the horse-breeding industry and has been difficult to control. The EAV virion consists of a genome-containing nucleocapsid core made of nucleocapsid (N) protein surrounded by a lipid envelope containing several membrane proteins. Here, the crystal structure of the capsid-forming domain of the EAV N protein is presented at 2.0 A resolution. The dimeric N-protein structure is similar to the previously determined structure of the N protein from PRRSV, with most differences localized to the terminal helices and flexible loops. The N protein is organized as dimers of dimers in the crystal, which may reflect the arrangement of the protein in the viral nucleocapsid.
The cold adapted and temperature sensitive influenza A/Ann Arbor/6/60 virus, the master donor virus for live attenuated influenza vaccines, has multiple defects in replication at the restrictive temperature.	We have previously determined that the temperature sensitive (ts) and attenuated (att) phenotypes of the cold adapted influenza A/Ann Arbor/6/60 strain (MDV-A), the master donor virus for the live attenuated influenza A vaccines (FluMist), are specified by the five amino acids in the PB1, PB2 and NP gene segments. To understand how these loci control the ts phenotype of MDV-A, replication of MDV-A at the non-permissive temperature (39 degrees C) was compared with recombinant wild-type A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (rWt). The mRNA and protein synthesis of MDV-A in the infected MDCK cells were not significantly reduced at 39 degrees C during a single-step replication, however, vRNA synthesis was reduced and the nuclear-cytoplasmic export of viral RNP (vRNP) was blocked. In addition, the virions released from MDV-A infected cells at 39 degrees C exhibited irregular morphology and had a greatly reduced amount of the M1 protein incorporated. The reduced M1 protein incorporation and vRNP export blockage correlated well with the virus ts phenotype because these defects could be partially alleviated by removing the three ts loci from the PB1 gene. The virions and vRNPs isolated from the MDV-A infected cells contained a higher level of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) than those of rWt, however, whether Hsp70 is involved in thermal inhibition of MDV-A replication remains to be determined. Our studies demonstrate that restrictive replication of MDV-A at the non-permissive temperature occurs in multiple steps of the virus replication cycle.
Discovery of frameshifting in Alphavirus 6K resolves a 20-year enigma.	The genus Alphavirus includes several potentially lethal human viruses. Additionally, species such as Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus are important vectors for gene therapy, vaccination and cancer research, and important models for virion assembly and structural analyses. The genome encodes nine known proteins, including the small '6K' protein. 6K appears to be involved in envelope protein processing, membrane permeabilization, virion assembly and virus budding. In protein gels, 6K migrates as a doublet--a result that, to date, has been attributed to differing degrees of acylation. Nonetheless, despite many years of research, its role is still relatively poorly understood.
Cold co-extraction of hemagglutinin and matrix M1 protein from influenza virus A by a combination of non-ionic detergents allows for visualization of the raft-like nature of the virus envelope.	Membrane solubilization with a mixture of cold non-ionic detergents has been applied to isolate detergent-resistant membranes from intact virus A lipid bilayer. Association of the viral envelope glycoproteins and M1 into a raft lipid-protein complex was verified via detergent insolubility experiments, and the M1:HA stoichiometry of the proposed supramolecular complex was estimated via amino acid analysis. Electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering data revealed that these lipid-protein rafts form unilamellar vesicles with HA spikes on their surfaces similar to influenza virus virions. Together, our data suggest that the cold co-extraction technique visualizes the raft-like nature of the viral envelope and demonstrates the interaction of matrix M1 protein with the envelope.
Gold nanoparticle arrangement on viral particles through carbohydrate recognition: a non-cross-linking approach to optical virus detection.	We propose a new approach to optical virus detection based on the spatial assembly of gold nanoparticles on the surface of viruses. Since JC virus-like particles (VLPs) comprise a repeating viral capsid protein that binds to sialic acid, the conjugation of sialic acid-linked Au particles with VLPs enables the spatial arrangement of Au particles on the VLP surface. This structure produced a red shift in the absorption spectrum due to plasmon coupling between adjacent Au particles, leading to the construction of an optical virus detection system. Our system depends not on the simple cross-linking of VLPs and Au particles, but on an ordered Au structure covering the entire surface of the VLPs and can be applied to various virus detection systems using the inherent ligand recognition of animal viruses.
Human cytomegalovirus final envelopment on membranes containing both trans-Golgi network and endosomal markers.	The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been shown to complete its final envelopment on cytoplasmic membranes prior to its secretion to the extracellular medium. However, the nature of these membranes has not been characterized. It is thought that HCMV acquires its final envelope from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), though we and others have previously reported a role for endocytic membranes. Here we studied the localization of cellular markers in HCMV-infected cells and in isolated viruses. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that HCMV induces the recruitment of TGN and endosomal markers to the virus factory. Immuno-gold labelling of isolated viral particles and electron microscopy demonstrated the incorporation of TGN46, endosomal markers early endosomal antigen 1, annexin I, transferrin receptor and CD63, and the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, which traffics between the TGN and endosomes into the viral envelope. Virus immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that virions containing TGN46 and CD63 were infectious. This study reconciles the apparent controversy regarding the nature of the HCMV assembly site and suggests that HCMV has the ability to generate a novel membrane compartment containing markers for both TGN and endosomes, or that the membranes that HCMV uses for its envelope may be vesicles in transit between the TGN and endosomes.
Using spectroscopic and microscopic methods to probe the structural stability of human adenovirus type 4.	Adenovirus serotype 4 (Ad4) is a major cause of Ad-associated human diseases. Ad4 is also considered to be a potential delivery vector for gene therapy. In this study, multiple spectroscopic techniques together with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to probe viral stability and to improve pharmaceutical formulations of Ad4-based vaccines and DNA carriers. Perturbations of secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure of Ad4 proteins induced by elevated temperatures over a wide pH range (3-8) were analyzed using circular dichroism, UV absorption and intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy as well as static and dynamic light scattering. The spectroscopic results obtained indicate a decrease in Ad4 stability as pH increases from 4 to 8, similar to the behavior reported previously for Ad2 and Ad5, although the Ad4 virion appears to possess slightly more tolerance to thermal stress. An empirical phase diagram (EPD) approach was used to summarize the data in the form of a colored map. In addition, the different physical states of Ad4 identified by the EPD were confirmed by TEM images. The results obtained in this study reveal both structural similarities among three commonly employed Ad subtypes (2, 4 and 5) as well as unique properties of Ad4.
A structural model for the single-stranded DNA genome of filamentous bacteriophage Pf1.	The filamentous bacteriophage Pf1, which infects strain PAK of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is a flexible filament ( approximately 2000 x 6.5 nm) consisting of a covalently closed DNA loop of 7349 nucleotides sheathed by 7350 copies of a 46-residue alpha-helical subunit. The subunit alpha-helices, which are inclined at a small average angle ( approximately 16 degrees ) from the virion axis, are arranged compactly around the DNA core. Orientations of the Pf1 DNA nucleotides with respect to the filament axis are not known. In this work we report and interpret the polarized Raman spectra of oriented Pf1 filaments. We demonstrate that the polarizations of DNA Raman band intensities establish that the nucleotide bases of packaged Pf1 DNA are well ordered within the virion and that the base planes are positioned close to parallel to the filament axis. The present results are combined with a previously proposed projection of the intraviral path of Pf1 DNA [Liu, D. J., and Day, L. A. (1994) Science 265, 671-674] to develop a novel molecular model for the Pf1 assembly.
Identification and characterization of a novel capsid protein encoded by Singapore grouper iridovirus ORF038L.	Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) is an important pathogen isolated from grouper, Epinephelus tauvina, and characterized as a novel ranavirus. To better understand the function of viral structural genes involved in SGIV infection and virus-host interactions, a candidate gene, VP38 (ORF038L), was investigated in this study. SGIV VP38 was found to encode a 170-aa peptide containing an RGD motif, and it showed significant identity only to members of the genus Iridovirus, family Iridoviridae, except megalocytivirus. The VP38 gene was identified by temporal expression pattern analysis and drug inhibition assay as a late (L) gene. Immunofluorescence localization revealed that P38 was distributed predominately in the cytoplasm and that association of VP38 with viral factories increased at the late stage of SGIV infection. Consistent results from immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) and western blot analysis revealed that SGIV VP38 is a viral capsid protein. Furthermore, antibodies specific for SGIV VP38 exhibited substantial SGIV-neutralizing activity in vitro, suggesting that VP38 might play an important role in SGIV infectivity.
Immunogenicity and virus-like particle formation of rotavirus capsid proteins produced in transgenic plants.	The human pathogen, group A rotavirus, is the most prevalent cause of acute infantile and pediatric gastroenteritis worldwide, especially in developing countries. There is an urgent demand for safer, more effective and cheaper vaccines against rotavirus infection. Plant-derived antigens may provide an exclusive way to produce economical subunit vaccines. Virus-like particles, constituting viral capsid proteins without viral nucleic acids, are considered a far safer candidate compared with live attenuated viral vaccines. In this study, the rotavirus capsid proteins VP2, VP6 and VP7 were co-expressed in transgenic tobacco plants, and their expression levels, formation of rotavirus-like particles (RV VLPs) and immunogenicity were extensively studied. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that the expression level of vp6 was the highest while vp7 was expressed at the lowest levels. The RV VLPs were purified from transgenic tobacco plants and analyzed by electron microscopy and Western blot. Results indicated that the plant-derived VP2, VP6 and VP7 proteins self-assembled into 2/6 or 2/6/7 RV VLPs with a diameter of 60-80 nm. When orally delivered into mice with cholera toxin as an adjuvant, the total soluble protein extracted from transgenic tobacco plants induced rotavirus-specific antibodies comparable with those of attenuated rotavirus vaccines, while VP 2/6/7 induced higher serum IgG and fecal IgA titers compared with VP 2/6.
Detection of chimpanzee polyomavirus-specific antibodies in captive and wild-caught chimpanzees using yeast-expressed virus-like particles.	Chimpanzee polyomavirus (ChPyV) was originally detected in the faeces of a captive chimpanzee by random screening using broad-spectrum PCR. Its pathogenicity and the distribution among chimpanzees are unknown so far. Here, the major capsid protein VP1 of ChPyV was expressed in yeast cells. Virus-like particles (VLPs) with a diameter of approximately 45nm were demonstrated although the efficiency of VLP formation was low as compared to monkey polyomavirus SV40-VLPs. The ChPyV-VLP preparation did not agglutinate human erythrocytes. Low cross-reactions between ChPyV- and SV40-VLP-specific sera were detected by immunoblotting, but not by ELISA. Testing of 163 sera derived from captive and wild-caught healthy chimpanzees using an ELISA based on the ChPyV-VLPs resulted in 11.7% positive results, ranging from 0% to 56% in different groups. The VLPs may be used in future to assess the distribution of ChPyV infections among other animal species and humans.
The antiviral spectra of TRIM5α orthologues and human TRIM family proteins against lentiviral production.	Rhesus monkey TRIM5α (TRIM5αrh) recognizes the incoming HIV-1 core through its C-terminal B30.2(PRYSPRY) domain and promotes its premature disassembly or degradation before reverse transcription. Previously, we have shown that TRIM5αrh blocks HIV-1 production through the N-terminal RBCC domain by the recognition of Gag polyproteins. Although all TRIM family proteins have RBCC domains, it remains elusive whether they possess similar late-restriction activities.
Cell surface display of poliovirus receptor on Escherichia coli, a novel method for concentrating viral particles in water.	The lack of efficient methods for concentrating viruses in water samples leads to underreporting of viral contamination in source water. A novel strategy for viral concentration was developed using the expression of target virus receptors on bacterial cells. Poliovirus type 1, the most studied enterovirus, was used as a surrogate for enteric viruses. The human poliovirus receptor (hPVR) gene was expressed on the surface of Escherichia coli cells by using the ice nucleation protein (INP) gene. The hPVR gene was ligated to the 3' end of the INP gene after the removal of the stop codon. The resulting open reading frame (ORF) was used for the projection of hPVR onto the outer membrane of E. coli. Gene expression was tested by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and dot blot analyses, and virion capture ability was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The application of engineered E. coli cells for capturing viruses in 1-liter samples of source and drinking water resulted in 75 to 99% procedural recovery efficiency. Cell surface display of viral receptors on bacterial cells opens a new prospect for an efficient and inexpensive alternative tool for capturing and concentrating waterborne viruses in water samples.
Fluorescein and radiolabeled Function-Spacer-Lipid constructs allow for simple in vitro and in vivo bioimaging of enveloped virions.	Tools that can aid in vitro and in vivo imaging and also noninvasively determine half-life and biodistribution are required to advance clinical developments. A Function-Spacer-Lipid construct (FSL) incorporating fluorescein (FSL-FLRO4) was used to label vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), measles virus MV-NIS (MV) and influenza virus (H1N1). The ability of FSL constructs to label these virions was established directly by FACScan of FSL-FLRO4 labeled VSV and MV, and indirectly following labeled H1N1 and MV binding to a cells. FSL-FLRO4 labeling of H1N1 was shown to maintain higher infectivity of the virus when compared with direct fluorescein virus labeling. A novel tyrosine (125)I radioiodinated FSL construct was synthesized (FSL-(125)I) from FSL-tyrosine. This was used to label VSV (VSV-FSL-(125)I), which was infused into the peritoneal cavity of laboratory mice. Bioscanning showed VSV-FSL-(125)I to localize in the liver, spleen and bloodstream in contrast to the free labels FSL-(125)I or (125)I, which localized predominantly in the liver and thyroid respectively. This is a proof-of-principle novel and rapid method for modifying virions and demonstrates the potential of FSL constructs to improve in vivo imaging of virions and noninvasively observe in vivo biodistribution.
The structural protein Gag of the gypsy retrovirus forms virus-like particles in the bacterial cell]	The amino acid sequence of the drosophila retrovirus MDG4 (gypsy) structural protein Gag does not contain a canonical motif known for the majority of vertebrate retroviruses. Moreover, the protein translation can theoretically begin with two separated initiation codons located within its unique open reading frame. We designed constructs for expression of two theoretically possible variants of Gag polypeptide and investigated an ability of the each product to form virus-like particles in the bacterial cell, i.e. in the absence of eukaryotic cell factors. The results obtained showed that the both variants of the gypsy protein Gag form globular particles in the bacterial cell.
Host cell processes to accomplish mechanical and non-circulative virus transmission.	Mechanical vector-less transmission of viruses, as well as vector-mediated non-circulative virus transmission, where the virus attaches only to the exterior of the vector during the passage to a new host, are apparently simple processes: the viruses are carried along with the wind, the food or by the vector to a new host. We discuss here, using the examples of the non-circulatively transmitted Cauliflower mosaic virus that binds to its aphid vector's exterior mouthparts, and that of the mechanically (during feeding activity) transmitted Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus, that transmission of these viruses is not so simple as previously thought. Rather, these viruses prepare their transmission carefully and long before the actual acquisition event. Host-virus interactions play a pivotal and specialised role in the future encounter with the vector or the new host. This ensures optimal propagation and enlarges the tremendous bottleneck transmission presents for viruses and other pathogens.
Identification of poliovirions and subviral particles by capillary electrophoresis.	Poliovirions, purified from infected cell extracts with anion-exchange chromatography, can be analyzed and identified by CE in untreated fused silica capillaries using UV detection. Other subviral particles can be eluted as well from the same infected cell extract using a higher salt concentration buffer on the ion-exchange chromatography. Virions can be identified because of their conversion into empty capsids upon heating at 56°C. As a result of heating, the viral genome is released from the capsid. Here, we show that during this incubation some intermediate particles were found. The latter were identified by enzymatic peak shift analysis. The high salt concentration eluate subviral particles were analyzed with preincubation affinity CE together with their sensitivity for RNase and proteinase K treatment. Electropherograms of the higher salt concentration eluate display a mixture of at least four different subviral particles. One particle proved to have an [N1, H] antigenicity and was resistant to RNase and proteinase K digestion. The remaining particles were all sensitive to proteinase K treatment. This CE method proved to be valuable in the detection, identification and analysis of poliovirions and poliovirus particles offering an alternative powerful, cheap, fast and easy analysis method.
Virus scaffolds as enzyme nano-carriers.	The cooperative organization of enzymes by cells is a key feature for the efficiency of living systems. In the field of nanotechnologies, effort currently aims at mimicking this natural organization. Nanoscale resolution and high-registration alignment are necessary to control enzyme distribution in nano-containers or on the surface of solid supports. Virus capsid self-assembly is driven by precise supramolecular combinations of protein monomers, which have made them attractive building blocks to engineer enzyme nano-carriers (ENCs). We discuss some examples of what in our opinion constitute the latest advances in the use of plant viruses, bacteriophages and virus-like particles (VLPs) as nano-scaffolds for enzyme selection, enzyme confinement and patterning, phage therapy, raw material processing, and single molecule enzyme kinetics studies.
Superresolution imaging of HIV in infected cells with FlAsH-PALM.	Imaging protein assemblies at molecular resolution without affecting biological function is a long-standing goal. The diffraction-limited resolution of conventional light microscopy (∼200-300 nm) has been overcome by recent superresolution (SR) methods including techniques based on accurate localization of molecules exhibiting stochastic fluorescence; however, SR methods still suffer important restrictions inherent to the protein labeling strategies. Antibody labels are encumbered by variable specificity, limited commercial availability and affinity, and are mostly restricted to fixed cells. Fluorescent protein fusions, though compatible with live cell imaging, substantially increase protein size and can interfere with their biological activity. We demonstrate SR imaging of proteins tagged with small tetracysteine motifs and the fluorescein arsenical helix binder (FlAsH-PALM). We applied FlAsH-PALM to image the integrase enzyme (IN) of HIV in fixed and living cells under experimental conditions that fully preserved HIV infectivity. The obtained resolution (∼30 nm) allowed us to characterize the distribution of IN within virions and intracellular complexes and to distinguish different HIV structural populations based on their morphology. We could thus discriminate ∼100 nm long mature conical cores from immature Gag shells and observe that in infected cells cytoplasmic (but not nuclear) IN complexes display a morphology similar to the conical capsid. Together with the presence of capsid proteins, our data suggest that cytoplasmic IN is largely present in intact capsids and that these can be found deep within the cytoplasm. FlAsH-PALM opens the door to in vivo SR studies of microbial complexes within host cells and may help achieve truly molecular resolution.
Incorporating global features of RNA motifs in predictions for an ensemble of secondary structures for encapsidated MS2 bacteriophage RNA.	The secondary structure of encapsidated MS2 genomic RNA poses an interesting RNA folding challenge. Cryoelectron microscopy has demonstrated that encapsidated MS2 RNA is well-ordered. Models of MS2 assembly suggest that the RNA hairpin-protein interactions and the appropriate placement of hairpins in the MS2 RNA secondary structure can guide the formation of the correct icosahedral particle. The RNA hairpin motif that is recognized by the MS2 capsid protein dimers, however, is energetically unfavorable, and thus free energy predictions are biased against this motif. Computer programs called Crumple, Sliding Windows, and Assembly provide useful tools for prediction of viral RNA secondary structures when the traditional assumptions of RNA structure prediction by free energy minimization may not apply. These methods allow incorporation of global features of the RNA fold and motifs that are difficult to include directly in minimum free energy predictions. For example, with MS2 RNA the experimental data from SELEX experiments, crystallography, and theoretical calculations of the path for the series of hairpins can be incorporated in the RNA structure prediction, and thus the influence of free energy considerations can be modulated. This approach thoroughly explores conformational space and generates an ensemble of secondary structures. The predictions from this new approach can test hypotheses and models of viral assembly and guide construction of complete three-dimensional models of virus particles.
A kinetic Zipper model and the assembly of tobacco mosaic virus.	We put forward a modified Zipper model inspired by the statics and dynamics of the spontaneous reconstitution of rodlike tobacco mosaic virus particles in solutions containing the coat protein and the single-stranded RNA of the virus. An important ingredient of our model is an allosteric switch associated with the binding of the first protein unit to the origin-of-assembly domain of the viral RNA. The subsequent addition and conformational switching of coat proteins to the growing capsid we believe is catalyzed by the presence of the helical arrangement of bound proteins to the RNA. The model explains why the formation of complete viruses is favored over incomplete ones, even though the process is quasi-one-dimensional in character. We numerically solve the relevant kinetic equations and show that time evolution is different for the assembly and disassembly of the virus, the former exhibiting a time lag even if all forward rate constants are equal. We find the late-stage assembly kinetics in the presence of excess protein to be governed by a single-exponential relaxation, which agrees with available experimental data on TMV reconstruction.
Characterization of rhinovirus subviral A particles via capillary electrophoresis, electron microscopy and gas-phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis: Part I.	During infection, enteroviruses, such as human rhinoviruses (HRVs), convert from the native, infective form with a sedimentation coefficient of 150S to empty subviral particles sedimenting at 80S (B particles). B particles lack viral capsid protein 4 (VP4) and the single-stranded RNA genome. On the way to this end stage, a metastable intermediate particle is observed in the cell early after infection. This subviral A particle still contains the RNA but lacks VP4 and sediments at 135S. Native (150S) HRV serotype 2 (HRV2) as well as its empty (80S) capsid have been well characterized by capillary electrophoresis. In the present paper, we demonstrate separation of at least two forms of subviral A particles on the midway between native virions and empty 80S capsids by CE. For one of these intermediates, we established a reproducible way for its preparation and characterized this particle in terms of its electrophoretic mobility and its appearance in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the conversion of this intermediate to 80S particles was investigated. Gas-phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (GEMMA) yielded additional insights into sample composition. More data on particle characterization including its protein composition and RNA content (for unambiguous identification of the detected intermediate as subviral A particle) will be presented in the second part of the publication.
Isolation, characterization and complete genome sequence of PhaxI: a phage of Escherichia coli O157 : H7.	Bacteriophages are considered as promising biological agents for the control of infectious diseases. Sequencing of their genomes can ascertain the absence of antibiotic resistance, toxin or virulence genes. The anti-O157 : H7 coliphage, PhaxI, was isolated from a sewage sample in Iran. Morphological studies by transmission electron microscopy showed that it has an icosahedral capsid of 85-86 nm and a contractile tail of 115×15 nm. PhaxI contains dsDNA composed of 156 628 nt with a G+C content of 44.5 mol% that encodes 209 putative proteins. In MS analysis of phage particles, 92 structural proteins were identified. PhaxI lyses Escherichia coli O157 : H7 in Luria-Bertani medium and milk, has an eclipse period of 20 min and a latent period of 40 min, and has a burst size of about 420 particles per cell. PhaxI is a member of the genus 'Viunalikevirus' of the family Myoviridae and is specific for E. coli O157 : H7. 
The structure and host entry of an invertebrate parvovirus.	The 3.5-Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of mature cricket parvovirus (Acheta domesticus densovirus [AdDNV]) has been determined. Structural comparisons show that vertebrate and invertebrate parvoviruses have evolved independently, although there are common structural features among all parvovirus capsid proteins. It was shown that raising the temperature of the AdDNV particles caused a loss of their genomes. The structure of these emptied particles was determined by cryo-electron microscopy to 5.5-Å resolution, and the capsid structure was found to be the same as that for the full, mature virus except for the absence of the three ordered nucleotides observed in the crystal structure. The viral protein 1 (VP1) amino termini could be externalized without significant damage to the capsid. In vitro, this externalization of the VP1 amino termini is accompanied by the release of the viral genome. 
Configuration of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes within the influenza A virion.	The influenza A virus possesses an eight-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome (vRNA). Each vRNA segment binds to multiple copies of viral nucleoproteins and a small number of heterotrimeric polymerase complexes to form a rod-like ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), which is essential for the transcription and replication of the vRNAs. However, how the RNPs are organized within the progeny virion is not fully understood. Here, by focusing on polymerase complexes, we analyzed the fine structure of purified RNPs and their configuration within virions by using various electron microscopies (EM). We confirmed that the individual RNPs possess a single polymerase complex at one end of the rod-like structure and that, as determined using immune EM, some RNPs are incorporated into budding virions with their polymerase-binding ends at the budding tip, whereas others align with their polymerase-binding ends at the bottom of the virion. These data further our understanding of influenza virus virion morphogenesis. 
Purification of hepatitis B surface antigen virus-like particles from recombinant Pichia pastoris and in vivo analysis of their immunogenic properties.	Following earlier studies on high-level intracellular production of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) using recombinant Pichia pastoris, we present here in detail an enhanced method for the purification of recombinant HBsAg virus-like particles (VLPs). We have screened various detergents for their ability to promote the solubilization of recombinant intracellular HBsAg. In addition, we have analyzed the effect of cell disruption and extraction regarding their impact on the release of HBsAg. Our results show that introduction of the mild nonionic detergent Tween 20 in the initial process of cell lysis at ∼600bars by high pressure homogenization leads to the best results. The subsequent purification steps involved polyethylene glycol precipitation of host cell contaminants, hydrophobic adsorption of HBsAg to colloidal silica followed by ion-exchange chromatography and either isopycnic density ultracentrifugation or size exclusion chromatography for the recovery of the VLPs. After final KSCN treatment and dialysis, a total yield of ∼3% with a purity of >99% was reached. The pure protein was characterized by electron microscopy, showing the presence of uniform VLPs which are the pre-requisite for immunogenicity. The intramuscular co-administration of HBsAg VLPs, with either alum or a PEGylated-derivative of the toll-like receptor 2/6 agonist MALP-2, to mice resulted in the elicitation of significantly higher HBsAg-specific IgG titers as well as a stronger cellular immune response compared to mice vaccinated with a gold standard vaccine (Engerix™). These results show that P. pastoris derived HBsAg VLPs exhibit a high potential as a superior biosimilar vaccine against hepatitis B. 
Annexin A6-balanced late endosomal cholesterol controls influenza A replication and propagation.	Influenza is caused by influenza A virus (IAV), an enveloped, negative-stranded RNA virus that derives its envelope lipids from the host cell plasma membrane. Here, we examined the functional role of cellular cholesterol in the IAV infection cycle. We show that shifting of cellular cholesterol pools via the Ca(2+)-regulated membrane-binding protein annexin A6 (AnxA6) affects the infectivity of progeny virus particles. Elevated levels of cellular AnxA6, which decrease plasma membrane and increase late endosomal cholesterol levels, impaired IAV replication and propagation, whereas RNA interference-mediated AnxA6 ablation increased viral progeny titers. Pharmacological accumulation of late endosomal cholesterol also diminished IAV virus propagation. Decreased IAV replication caused by upregulated AnxA6 expression could be restored either by exogenous replenishment of host cell cholesterol or by ectopic expression of the late endosomal cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). Virus released from AnxA6-overexpressing cells displayed significantly reduced cholesterol levels. Our results show that IAV replication depends on maintenance of the cellular cholesterol balance and identify AnxA6 as a critical factor in linking IAV to cellular cholesterol homeostasis.
Host resistance selects for traits unrelated to resistance-breaking that affect fitness in a plant virus.	The acquisition by parasites of the capacity to infect resistant host genotypes, that is, resistance-breaking, is predicted to be hindered by across-host fitness trade-offs. All analyses of costs of resistance-breaking in plant viruses have focused on within-host multiplication without considering other fitness components, which may limit understanding of virus evolution. We have reported that host range expansion of tobamoviruses on L-gene resistant pepper genotypes was associated with severe within-host multiplication penalties. Here, we analyze whether resistance-breaking costs might affect virus survival in the environment by comparing tobamovirus pathotypes differing in infectivity on L-gene resistance alleles. We predicted particle stability from structural models, analyzed particle stability in vitro, and quantified virus accumulation in different plant organs and virus survival in the soil. Survival in the soil differed among tobamovirus pathotypes and depended on differential stability of virus particles. Structure model analyses showed that amino acid changes in the virus coat protein (CP) responsible for resistance-breaking affected the strength of the axial interactions among CP subunits in the rod-shaped particle, thus determining its stability and survival. Pathotypes ranked differently for particle stability/survival and for within-host accumulation. Resistance-breaking costs in survival add to, or subtract from, costs in multiplication according to pathotype. Hence, differential pathotype survival should be considered along with differential multiplication to understand the evolution of the virus populations. Results also show that plant resistance, in addition to selecting for resistance-breaking and for decreased multiplication, also selects for changes in survival, a trait unrelated to the host-pathogen interaction that may condition host range expansion. 
Learning from nature - novel synthetic biology approaches for biomaterial design.	Many biomaterials constructed today are complex chemical structures that incorporate biologically active components derived from nature, but the field can still be said to be in its infancy. The need for materials that bring sophisticated properties of structure, dynamics and function to medical and non-medical applications will only grow. Increasing appreciation of the functionality of biological systems has caused biomaterials researchers to consider nature for design inspiration, and many examples exist of the use of biomolecular motifs. Yet evolution, nature's only engine for the creation of new designs, has been largely ignored by the biomaterials community. Molecular evolution is an emerging tool that enables one to apply nature's engineering principles to non-natural situations using variation and selection. The purpose of this review is to highlight the most recent advances in the use of molecular evolution in synthetic biology applications for biomaterial engineering, and to discuss some of the areas in which this approach may be successfully applied in the future. 
Structural plasticity of the Semliki Forest virus glycome upon interspecies transmission.	Cross-species viral transmission subjects parent and progeny alphaviruses to differential post-translational processing of viral envelope glycoproteins. Alphavirus biogenesis has been extensively studied, and the Semliki Forest virus E1 and E2 glycoproteins have been shown to exhibit differing degrees of processing of N-linked glycans. However the composition of these glycans, including that arising from different host cells, has not been determined. Here we determined the chemical composition of the glycans from the prototypic alphavirus, Semliki Forest virus, propagated in both arthropod and rodent cell lines, by using ion-mobility mass spectrometry and collision-induced dissociation analysis. We observe that both the membrane-proximal E1 fusion glycoprotein and the protruding E2 attachment glycoprotein display heterogeneous glycosylation that contains N-linked glycans exhibiting both limited and extensive processing. However, E1 contained predominantly highly processed glycans dependent on the host cell, with rodent and mosquito-derived E1 exhibiting complex-type and paucimannose-type glycosylation, respectively. In contrast, the protruding E2 attachment glycoprotein primarily contained conserved under-processed oligomannose-type structures when produced in both rodent and mosquito cell lines. It is likely that glycan processing of E2 is structurally restricted by steric-hindrance imposed by local viral protein structure. This contrasts E1, which presents glycans characteristic of the host cell and is accessible to enzymes. We integrated our findings with previous cryo-electron microscopy and crystallographic analyses to produce a detailed model of the glycosylated mature virion surface. Taken together, these data reveal the degree to which virally encoded protein structure and cellular processing enzymes shape the virion glycome during interspecies transmission of Semliki Forest virus. 
Structure and assembly of filamentous bacteriophages.	Filamentous bacteriophages are interesting paradigms in structural molecular biology, in part because of the unusual mechanism of filamentous phage assembly. During assembly, several thousand copies of an intracellular DNA-binding protein bind to each copy of the replicating phage DNA, and are then displaced by membrane-spanning phage coat proteins as the nascent phage is extruded through the bacterial plasma membrane. This complicated process takes place without killing the host bacterium. The bacteriophage is a semi-flexible worm-like nucleoprotein filament. The virion comprises a tube of several thousand identical major coat protein subunits around a core of single-stranded circular DNA. Each protein subunit is a polymer of about 50 amino-acid residues, largely arranged in an α-helix. The subunits assemble into a helical sheath, with each subunit oriented at a small angle to the virion axis and interdigitated with neighbouring subunits. A few copies of "minor" phage proteins necessary for infection and/or extrusion of the virion are located at each end of the completed virion. Here we review both the structure of the virion and aspects of its function, such as the way the virion enters the host, multiplies, and exits to prey on further hosts. In particular we focus on our understanding of the way the components of the virion come together during assembly at the membrane. We try to follow a basic rule of empirical science, that one should chose the simplest theoretical explanation for experiments, but be prepared to modify or even abandon this explanation as new experiments add more detail. 
Expanding the genetic code for site-specific labelling of tobacco mosaic virus coat protein and building biotin-functionalized virus-like particles.	A method for site-specific and high yield modification of tobacco mosaic virus coat protein (TMVCP) utilizing a genetic code expanding technology and copper free cycloaddition reaction has been established, and biotin-functionalized virus-like particles were built by the self-assembly of the protein monomers. 
Potent dengue virus neutralization by a therapeutic antibody with low monovalent affinity requires bivalent engagement.	We recently described our most potently neutralizing monoclonal antibody, E106, which protected against lethal Dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) infection in mice. To further understand its functional properties, we determined the crystal structure of E106 Fab in complex with domain III (DIII) of DENV-1 envelope (E) protein to 2.45 Å resolution. Analysis of the complex revealed a small antibody-antigen interface with the epitope on DIII composed of nine residues along the lateral ridge and A-strand regions. Despite strong virus neutralizing activity of E106 IgG at picomolar concentrations, E106 Fab exhibited a ∼20,000-fold decrease in virus neutralization and bound isolated DIII, E, or viral particles with only a micromolar monovalent affinity. In comparison, E106 IgG bound DENV-1 virions with nanomolar avidity. The E106 epitope appears readily accessible on virions, as neutralization was largely temperature-independent. Collectively, our data suggest that E106 neutralizes DENV-1 infection through bivalent engagement of adjacent DIII subunits on a single virion. The isolation of anti-flavivirus antibodies that require bivalent binding to inhibit infection efficiently may be a rare event due to the unique icosahedral arrangement of envelope proteins on the virion surface. 
The phospholipid composition of extracellular herpes simplex virions differs from that of host cell nuclei.	Enveloped viruses of eukaryotes obtain their membrane by budding through a cellular membrane. Therefore, most frequently the lipid composition of the virion envelope reflects that of the membrane where budding took place. In the case of herpes simplex viruses, nucleocapsids assemble in the nucleus and bud through the inner nuclear membrane. The pathway from the perinuclear space to the extracellular medium is as yet poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the phospholipid composition of extracellular herpes simplex virions differs from that of nuclei isolated from the infected cells. The viral membrane contains threefold higher concentrations of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylserine. These lipids are typically enriched in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane. The data are in agreement with a model in which herpes simplex virus, after budding through the inner nuclear membrane, loses its envelope by fusing with the outer nuclear membrane and obtains a new membrane by budding into a compartment late in the exocytotic pathway, very likely the Golgi apparatus or membranes derived from it. Alternatively, because the perinuclear space is continuous with the ER lumen, the virus after its first budding may be transported through the exocytotic pathway without ever leaving the lumen of the subsequent compartments. In that case, either the virions, while budding through the nuclear membrane select for sphingomyelin and phosphatidylserine, or the original lipids of the viral envelope are exchanged for lipids of an exocytotic membrane, most likely by a transient membrane continuity between the virion and the vesicle by which it is surrounded. Light particles, virus-like particles that lack capsid and DNA but contain tegument and envelope proteins, displayed the same lipid composition as complete herpes simplex virions, suggesting that they also acquired their envelope from a Golgi membrane.
Purification of viruses and macromolecular assemblies for structural investigations using a novel ion exchange method.	We describe a novel ion exchange chromatographic technique suitable for large-scale preparation of viruses and other biomacromolecular assemblies in highly purified form. The method, which utilizes anion exchange on either of two commercially available cellulose cartridges, is applied to the Escherichia coli bacteriophage PRD1. Viral particles eluted from both QMA and DEAE cartridges retain infectivity and exhibit greater homogeneity of composition, as judged by gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy, than particles purified by rate zonal sucrose gradient centrifugation. The ion exchange protocols are rapid, requiring less than 15 min elution time, and permit retrieval of the purified viral particles at high concentration in aqueous media without centrifugal pelleting. The present method is particularly well suited to the preparation of milligram to decigram quantities of virus, sufficient for many biophysical structural analyses, including investigations by solution spectroscopic and crystal diffraction techniques. The feasibility and advantages of the ion exchange chromatographic procedure are demonstrated by application of laser Raman spectroscopy to ion exchange purified PRD1 virions and subviral assemblies.
Analysis of messenger RNA within virions of IBV.	The presence of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs) in virions of infectious bronchitis virus was examined by probing Northern blots of RNA extracted from virions using as a probe a cDNA of the 3'-terminal nucleocapsid protein (N) gene. The sgRNAs were readily detected even after extensive purification of virions and after RNase A treatment of virions. The molar ratio of gRNA to each sgRNA was in the range 25 to 400 for IBV-M41 and 10 to 30 for IBV-Beaudette. After comparison with the molar ratios of genomic to intracellular viral sgRNAs it was estimated that the efficiency of incorporation of gRNA into virions was approximately 100 to 500-fold greater than for sgRNAs in the case of M41 and 20 to 100-fold for Beaudette, depending on the sgRNA species. It is concluded that sgRNAs can be present within IBV virions. Approximately 1 in 3 Beaudette virions and 1 in 20 M41 particles might contain a single copy of one sgRNA.
Developments in the understanding of the particle structure of tobraviruses.	Particles of tobraviruses resemble those of tobacco mosaic tobramovirus (TMV) in having helical symmetry and in being rod-shaped. However, isolated tobravirus coat protein and TMV coat protein respond to changes in the ionic strength and pH of the solute in contrasting ways. The types of aggregate formed in solutions of coat protein also differ which may be related to differences in the apparent mechanism of reconstitution of virus particles from isolated protein and RNA. The amino acid sequences of tobravirus and tobramovirus coat proteins have been shown to be similar in some regions known to be important for the structure of TMV particles. These alignments also show that tobravirus proteins are larger than tobramoviral proteins in part because of extra residues at the C-terminus. Tobravirus particles give a signal in proton NMR spectroscopy but TMV particles do not. The signal is caused by segmental mobility of the C-terminal peptide. This difference between TMV and tobraviruses may be related to a property not shared by tobraviruses and TMV and it is therefore speculated that the mobile C-terminal peptide of tobravirus coat proteins may be important in the transmission of tobravirus particles by nematode vectors.
Characterization of different electrophoretic forms of cauliflower mosaic virus virions (strain Cabb-S).	The electrophoretic forms of purified cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), strain Cabb-S, were examined by electrophoresis on agarose gels. Three populations of viral particles were identified: a faster migrating component (the form F) and two slower migrating components (the forms S and S'). When the different forms of virions, after excision from gels, were subjected to analysis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the fast component consisted of the 37 and 42 kDa coat proteins whereas the slow components contained mainly the 39 kDa coat protein. However, there was no difference among the nucleic acids associated within the three forms. The biological significance of the different components is discussed.
The thermal stability and decapsidation mechanism of tymoviruses: a differential calorimetric study.	The thermal stability of virions present in purified suspensions of three tymoviruses, turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV), belladonna mottle virus (BelMV) and eggplant mosaic virus (EMV) was investigated by microcalorimetry. Virions are less stable than natural empty shells at 4.5 < or = pH < or = 8.5. Polyvalent cations present in TYMV stabilize the virions at pH < or = 5.0 only. Virions decapsidate in three steps: i) the release of the viral RNA, probably through a hole in the capsid; ii) the dissociation of the artificial empty shells thus formed; and iii) the denaturation of the dissociated components. An exothermic process accompanies the first step. Structural implications are discussed.
Structure of the amino-terminal core domain of the HIV-1 capsid protein.	The three-dimensional structure of the amino-terminal core domain (residues 1 through 151) of the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) capsid protein has been solved by multidimensional heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structure is unlike those of previously characterized viral coat proteins and is composed of seven alpha helices, two beta hairpins, and an exposed partially ordered loop. The domain is shaped like an arrowhead, with the beta hairpins and loop exposed at the trailing edge and the carboxyl-terminal helix projecting from the tip. The proline residue Pro1 forms a salt bridge with a conserved, buried aspartate residue (Asp51), which suggests that the amino terminus of the protein rearranges upon proteolytic maturation. The binding site for cyclophilin A, a cellular rotamase that is packaged into the HIV-1 virion, is located on the exposed loop and encompasses the essential proline residue Pro90. In the free monomeric domain, Pro90 adopts kinetically trapped cis and trans conformations, raising the possibility that cyclophilin A catalyzes interconversion of the cis- and trans-Pro90 loop structures.
Subunit orientation in the filamentous virus Ff(fd, f1, M13).	The Ff filamentous viruses (fd, M13, f1) are important models for membrane protein assembly and are used extensively as cloning vectors and vehicles for peptide display. The thread-like virion (approximately 6 nm x 880 nm) comprises a single-stranded DNA genome sheathed by approximately 2700 copies of a 50-residue alpha-helical subunit (pVIII). The average inclination of pVIII subunits from the virion axis has been determined experimentally by polarized Raman microspectroscopy of oriented fd fibers, using the amide I Raman tensors obtained from a peptide single crystal. It is found that the average tilt angle, theta, between the pVIII alpha-helix and the virion axis falls within the range 13< theta <20 degrees.
Recombinant subviral particles from tick-borne encephalitis virus are fusogenic and provide a model system for studying flavivirus envelope glycoprotein functions.	Recombinant subviral particles (RSPs) obtained by coexpression of the envelope (E) and premembrane (prM) proteins of tick-borne encephalitis virus in COS cells (S. L. Allison, K. Stadler, C. W. Mandl, C. Kunz, and F. X. Heinz, J. Virol. 69:5816-5820, 1995) were extensively characterized and shown to be ordered structures containing envelope glycoproteins with structural and functional properties very similar to those in the virion envelope. The particles were spherical, with a diameter of about 30 nm and a buoyant density of 1.14 g/cm3 in sucrose gradients. They contained mature E proteins with endoglycosidase H-resistant glycans as well as fully cleaved mature M proteins. Cleavage of prM, which requires an acidic pH in exocytic compartments, could be inhibited by treatment of transfected cells with ammonium chloride, implying a common maturation pathway for RSPs and virions. RSPs incorporated [14C]choline but not [3H]uridine, demonstrating that they contain lipid but probably lack nucleic acid. The envelope proteins of RSPs exhibited a native antigenic and oligomeric structure compared with virions, and incubation at an acidic pH (pH <6.5) induced identical conformational changes and structural rearrangements, including an irreversible quantitative conversion of dimers to trimers. The RSPs were also shown to be functionally active, inducing membrane fusion in a low-pH-dependent manner and demonstrating the same specific hemagglutination activity as whole virions. Tick-borne encephalitis virus RSPs thus represent an excellent model system for investigating the structural basis of viral envelope glycoprotein functions.
Proteins encoded by open reading frames 3 and 4 of the genome of Lelystad virus (Arteriviridae) are structural proteins of the virion.	Four structural proteins of Lelystad virus (Arteriviridae) were recognized by monoclonal antibodies in a Western immunoblotting experiment with purified virus. In addition to the 18-kDa integral membrane protein M and the 15-kDa nucleocapsid protein N, two new structural proteins with molecular masses of 45 to 50 kDa and 31 to 35 kDa, respectively, were detected. Monoclonal antibodies that recognized proteins of 45 to 50 kDa and 31 to 35 kDa immunoprecipitated similar proteins expressed from open reading frames (ORFs) 3 and 4 in baculovirus recombinants, respectively. Therefore, the 45- to 50-kDa protein is encoded by ORF3 and the 31- to 35-kDa protein is encoded by ORF4. Peptide-N-glycosidase F digestion of purified virus reduced the 45- to 50-kDa and 31- to 35-kDa proteins to core proteins of 29 and 16 kDa, respectively, which indicates N glycosylation of these proteins in the virion. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the 31- to 35-kDa protein neutralized Lelystad virus, which indicates that at least part of this protein is exposed at the virion surface. We propose that the 45- to 50-kDa and 31- to 35-kDa structural proteins of Lelystad virus be named GP3 and GP4, to reflect their glycosylation and the ORFs from which they are expressed. Antibodies specific for GP3 and GP4 were detected by a Western immunoblotting assay in swine serum after an infection with Lelystad virus.
The transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus contains a spherical core shell consisting of M and N proteins.	Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses involved in a variety of pathologies that affect animals and humans. Existing structural models of these viruses propose a helical nucleocapsid under the virion envelope as the unique internal structure. In the present work, we have analyzed the structure of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus. The definition of its organization supports a new structural model for coronaviruses, since a spherical, probably icosahedral, internal core has been characterized. Disruption of these cores induces the release of N-protein-containing helical nucleocapsids. Immunogold mapping and protein analysis of purified cores showed that they consist of M and N proteins, M being the main core shell component. This surprising finding, together with the fact that M protein molecules are also located in the virion envelope, indicates that a reconsideration of the assembly and maturation of coronaviruses, as well as a study of potential M-protein subclasses, is needed.
Structure of the capsid of Pf3 filamentous phage determined from X-ray fibre diffraction data at 3.1 A resolution.	We have recorded X-ray diffraction patterns at 3.1 A resolution from magnetically aligned fibres of the Pf3 strain of filamentous bacteriophage (Inovirus). The patterns are similar to patterns from the higher-temperature form of the Pf1 strain, indicating that the Pf3 and Pf1 virions have the same helix symmetry and similar protein subunit shape. This is of particular interest, given that the primary structures of the two protein subunits are quite different; and the nucleotide/protein subunit ratio in the Pf3 virion is more than twice that in Pf1, indicating important differences in DNA packaging. We have built a molecular model of the Pf3 protein capsid based on the model of Pf1, and refined it against the diffraction data using simulated annealing. The refinement confirms that the two structures are similar, which may reflect a fundamental motif of alpha-helix packing. However, there are some differences between the structures: the Pf3 subunit appears to be completely alpha-helical, beginning at the N terminus, whereas the first few residues of the Pf1 subunit are not helical; and the structure of the C-terminal region of the Pf3 subunit at the inner surface of the tubular capsid indicates that DNA/protein interactions in this virion may involve both aromatic side-chains and positively charged side-chains, whereas those in the Pf1 virion involve predominantly only the latter. In the course of this work, we have developed new approaches to refinement and validation of helical structures with respect to continuous transform fibre diffraction data.
Differences in the intracellular localization and fate of herpes simplex virus tegument proteins early in the infection of Vero cells.	The fate of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) tegument proteins during infection in Vero cells was investigated immunochemically. Input virion-associated VP13/14 and VP16 localized to the nucleus early in infection, while VP1/2 localized to the nuclear envelope of the cell and VP22 could not be detected using monoclonal antibody P43. Western blotting suggested that virion-associated VP13/14, VP16 and VP22 were stable in infected cells whereas VP1/2 appeared to be processed or modified. Further studies showed that P43 recognized a phosphorylation-sensitive epitope in VP22 and suggested that virion-associated VP22 was phosphorylated upon entry to the cell. VP13/14 and VP16 were easily extracted from cells early in infection whereas VP22 was largely insoluble. Phosphatase treatment of soluble extracts caused a shift in the molecular mass of VP16 showing it was phosphorylated. As infection progressed VP16 was observed in discrete nuclear compartments where it co-localized with ICP8 and the capsid-associated protein VP22a. VP13/14 was also observed in the nucleus. P43 immunostaining appeared around 6 h post-infection as punctate nuclear foci which often localized to the edge of VP16-immunoreactive areas. Punctate P43 cytoplasmic staining appeared around 12 h post-infection. By 18 h the nuclear pattern had disappeared and an extensive cytoplasmic stain was observed which closely overlapped that of other tegument proteins. On the basis of these data we suggest that virion-associated VP22 is phosphorylated upon entry of the virus into the cell and that unphosphorylated VP22, which is preferentially recognized by P43, becomes available later in infection, initially in the nucleus, for packaging into virions.
Virus maturation by budding.	Enveloped viruses mature by budding at cellular membranes. It has been generally thought that this process is driven by interactions between the viral transmembrane proteins and the internal virion components (core, capsid, or nucleocapsid). This model was particularly applicable to alphaviruses, which require both spike proteins and a nucleocapsid for budding. However, genetic studies have clearly shown that the retrovirus core protein, i.e., the Gag protein, is able to form enveloped particles by itself. Also, budding of negative-strand RNA viruses (rhabdoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and paramyxoviruses) seems to be accomplished mainly by internal components, most probably the matrix protein, since the spike proteins are not absolutely required for budding of these viruses either. In contrast, budding of coronavirus particles can occur in the absence of the nucleocapsid and appears to require two membrane proteins only. Biochemical and structural data suggest that the proteins, which play a key role in budding, drive this process by forming a three-dimensional (cage-like) protein lattice at the surface of or within the membrane. Similarly, recent electron microscopic studies revealed that the alphavirus spike proteins are also engaged in extensive lateral interactions, forming a dense protein shell at the outer surface of the viral envelope. On the basis of these data, we propose that the budding of enveloped viruses in general is governed by lateral interactions between peripheral or integral membrane proteins. This new concept also provides answers to the question of how viral and cellular membrane proteins are sorted during budding. In addition, it has implications for the mechanism by which the virion is uncoated during virus entry.
Analysis of core virion polypeptides from the pathogen causing chicken egg-drop syndrome]	The cores of egg-drop syndrome virus (EDS-76) were isolated by the pyridine technique. EDS-76 proved to be much more resistant to pyridine disruption than other adenoviruses and treatment with 10% pyridine did not lead to complete dissociation of capsid and cores; only increase of pyridine concentration to 20% produced satisfactory results. At least three polypeptides (24, 10.5, and 6.5 kDa) were found in the core by SDS-PAGE, whereas the 40 kDa reacting with the core is most probably not a core component. Much more intensive reactions of the core with EDS-76 virion capsid suggest that its virion structure differs from that of other adenoviruses.
