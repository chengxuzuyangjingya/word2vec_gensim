Hospitalizations for pediatric stone disease in United States, 2002-2007.	Although more common in adults, urolithiasis recently has been occurring with increasing frequency in children. Single institution reviews from 1950 to 1990 revealed that urolithiasis accounts for 1 in 7,600 to 1 in 1,000 pediatric hospitalizations. Stone prevalence and risk factors for hospitalization are less defined in children in North America compared to adults. To identify pediatric hospital admissions due to a diagnosis of urinary stones, we examined Pediatric Health Information System data from 41 freestanding pediatric hospitals.
