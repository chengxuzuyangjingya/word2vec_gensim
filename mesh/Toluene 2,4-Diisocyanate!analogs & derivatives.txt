Testing of household products and materials for emission of toluene diisocyanate.	Polyurethane products were subjected to chamber testing to determine their emission rates of 2,4- and 2,6-toluene diisocyanate (TDI). The polyurethane (PU) products included carpet padding, furniture cushions, sheet foam, varnishes, and sealants, as well as a commercially-applied water sealant product for concrete that contained up to 4 percent TDI by weight. The PU products were screened in a 9-L glass chamber, under elevated temperature and chamber loading conditions, using both a time-integrated sampling and analysis method specific for TDI and a continuous but non-specific real-time monitor for isocyanates. None of the products normally found in residences showed a positive response in the screening tests, indicating that TDI emissions and consequently toxic effects from such products are negligible. However, the commercially-applied water sealant gave a positive response in the screening test. Further testing of that product at realistic temperatures showed initial TDI emission rates of about 300,000 micrograms/m2/hr, with emissions lasting only one hour or less. At 21 and 27 degrees C, about 1 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of the TDI content of the product was released to the air. The emitted TDI was predominantly the 2,6-isomer, although the TDI originally present in the product was predominantly the 2,4-isomer.
