Polymorphism of the DNA repair gene ERCC2 Lys751Gln and risk of lung cancer in a northeastern Chinese population.	The ERCC2 gene (excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency, complementation group 2 [xeroderma pigmentosum D]) (previously XPD), encoding a DNA repair protein, is involved in nucleotide excision repair and basal transcription. To test the effect of the polymorphism ERCC2 Lys751Gln on the risk of lung cancer in a northeastern Chinese population, a hospital-based case-control study was designed consisting of 147 newly diagnosed and previously untreated subjects with lung cancer and 145 cancer-free control subjects matched on age (+/-3 years), gender, and ethnicity. Among the controls, the allele frequency of the C-allele of ERCC2 Lys751Gln was 0.02. The C-allele of ERCC2 Lys751Gln was significantly overrepresented among lung cancer cases (C versus A: adjusted odds ratio OR(adj) = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.12-6.05, P = 0.03). The carriers of AC genotype were at 2.78-fold (OR(adj) = 2.78, 95% CI = 1.12-6.93) higher risk of lung cancer than carriers of the AA genotype. Subdivided by tumor type, carriers of AC genotype had a 4.65-fold higher risk of squamous cell carcinoma of lung compared with carriers of AA genotype (OR(adj) = 4.65, 95% CI = 1.67-12.98, P = 0.003); similar, but not statistically significant estimates were found for adenocarcinoma of lung. In conclusion, our results suggest that ERCC2 Lys751Gln(C) allele is a potential risk marker for lung cancer in this northeastern Chinese population.
Distinct roles for the XPB/p52 and XPD/p44 subcomplexes of TFIIH in damaged DNA opening during nucleotide excision repair.	Mutations in XPB, an essential subunit of the transcription/repair factor TFIIH, lead to nucleotide excision repair (NER) defects and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). The role of XPB in NER and the molecular mechanisms resulting in XP are poorly understood. Here, we show that the p52 subunit of TFIIH interacts with XPB and stimulates its ATPase activity. A mutation found among XP-B patients (F99S) weakens this interaction and the resulting ATPase stimulation, thereby explaining the defect in the damaged DNA opening. We next found that mutations in the helicase motifs III (T469A) and VI (Q638A) that inhibit XPB helicase activity preserve the NER function of TFIIH. Our results suggest a mechanism in which the helicase activity of XPB is not used for the opening and repair of damaged DNA, which is instead only driven by its ATPase activity, in combination with the helicase activity of XPD.
