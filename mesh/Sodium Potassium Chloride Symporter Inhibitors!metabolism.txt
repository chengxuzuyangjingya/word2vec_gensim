Diuretics in clinical practice. Part I: mechanisms of action, pharmacological effects and clinical indications of diuretic compounds.	Diuretics are among the most important drugs of our therapeutic armamentarium and have been broadly used for > 50 years, providing important help towards the treatment of several diseases. Although all diuretics act primarily by impairing sodium reabsorption in the renal tubules, they differ in their mechanism and site of action and, therefore, in their specific pharmacological properties and clinical indications. Loop diuretics are mainly used for oedematous disorders (i.e., cardiac failure, nephrotic syndrome) and for blood pressure and volume control in renal disease; thiazides and related agents are among the most prescribed drugs for hypertension treatment; aldosterone-blockers are traditionally used for primary or secondary aldosteronism; and other diuretic classes have more specific indications.
