A preliminary review of the use of deep peroneal neurectomy for the treatment of painful midtarsal and tarsometatarsal arthritis.	This report describes a retrospective analysis of chart and radiographic data pertaining to 10 consecutive cases performed over a 30-month period, undertaken in an effort to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of denervation for pain relief in high-risk surgical candidates with midfoot and tarsometatarsal joint arthritis. Ten patients (13 feet) were treated, and objective and subjective assessments were obtained using an index of subjective patient satisfaction. Results revealed 9 (69.2%) feet from 7 (70%) patients had greater than 75% relief. Two (15.4%) feet from 2 (20%) patients had at least 50% improvement and 2 (15.4%) feet from 1 (10%) patient claimed no relief. Our results indicate that this method of treatment can be an effective way to relieve pain associated with arthrosis involving the midfoot and tarsometatarsal joints.
