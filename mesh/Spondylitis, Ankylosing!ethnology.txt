Population study of antibodies to some potential pathogens of spondyloarthopathies: the study of the Chukotka population]	The paper presents the results of the study of specific immune response stimulated by some enterobacteria in populations with high incidence of HLA-B27. A, M and G antibodies to Yersinia, Clebsiella, Salmonella and Campilobacter were studied on 292 plasma samples. The levels of the antibodies varied with anthropological parameters of the examinees (gender, age, nationality). The presence of the gene HLA-B27 in the genotype levels gender dimorphism of the specific humoral immune response. This may be of importance in pathogenesis of spondyloarthropathies which occur more frequently in men.

The association of HLA-B*27 subtypes with ankylosing spondylitis in Wuhan population of China.	The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the B27 subtypes with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in the Wuhan population of China. We selected 317 HLA-B27-positive individuals (145 controls and 172 patients with ankylosing spondylitis). The B27 subtypes were characterized using a PCR-SSP method. Six B27 subtypes were determined: B*2702, 03, 04, 05, 06 and B*13. HLA-B*2704 and HLA-B*2705 were the two high frequency genotypes in controls and patients. Compared with the controls, the AS patients had high frequency of B*2704 (patients 69.2% vs. controls 53.8%) and low frequency of B*2705 (patients 23.8% vs. controls 33.1%). B*2703 was detected in 10 (5.8%) patients and in 13 (8.9%) controls. B*2702, 06 and B*2713 were relatively rare. Our results show that the allele conferring risk to AS in the Wuhan population of China was B*2704 and B*2705. B*2704 is strongly associated with AS.
Association and frequency of HLA-A, B and HLA-DR genes in south Tunisian patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA).	The aim of this study is to investigate the association of HLA-A, B and HLA-DR gene expression and to assess an association of additional HLA antigens besides HLA-B27 in south Tunisian patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). Eighty-five patients diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis (AS, n=68) and reactive arthrithis (ReA, n=17) were selected and compared with 100 healthy controls (HC). HLA class I antigens were typed serologically using microlymphocytotoxicity technique. HLA-DRB1* alleles were studied by polymerase chain reaction amplification with sequence-specific primers. The significance of differences between patients and controls was tested by chi-square analysis. We found significantly increased frequencies of HLA-A3 (30.6%; pC=0.04; OR=2.95), HLA-B27 (62.35%; pC=4.10(-17), OR=53.55), and HLA-DRB1*15 (17.2%; pC=0.026; RR=2.58) alleles in SpA patients compared to HC. The most frequent and strongest association was observed for HLA-B27 in AS (pC=6.6 ×10(-16), OR=52.23). When AS and ReA patients were analysed separately, HLA-DRB1*15 and HLA-A3 were increased only in AS (pC=0.01, OR=2.99 and pC=0.03, OR=3.14, respectively). In ReA patients, HLA-DRB1*04 (p=0.033, pC=NS, OR=2.89) was found to be the most common allele. By analysing the HLA-B27-negative subgroup, HLA-A3 and HLA-DRB1*15 expression was found to be dependent on the presence of HLA-B27. HLA-B27 expression was higher in male (45/53; 85%) as compared to female (8/53; 15%) patients (p=0.03). Apart from HLA-B27, HLA-A3 and HLA-DRB1*15 are the MHC class I and II alleles found most frequent in Tunisian patients with AS, whereas HLA-DRB1*04 was found most frequent in ReA patients. HLA-B27 is more frequent in male than in female patients.

Associations of the PTPN22 and CTLA-4 genetic polymorphisms with Taiwanese ankylosing spondylitis.	Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an autoimmune disease, and the imbalance of peripheral tolerance is involved in its pathogenesis. Importantly, the negative signal of activated T cells plays a crucial role in the balance of peripheral tolerance. It has been postulated that human protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 22 (PTPN22) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) genes encode proteins that are actively involved in regulating T-cell activation. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of PTPN22 and CTLA-4 genotypes on the occurrence of AS. Genetic polymorphisms of PTPN22 -1123G/C and CTLA-4 +49A/G were identified by polymerase chain reaction for 391 AS patients and 391 healthy controls. Subjects with PTPN22 CC and GC genotypes had a greater risk of AS occurrence than those with PTPN22 GG genotype [relative risk = 1.39, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1.03-1.88]. Further, subjects with PTPN22 CC/CTLA-4 AA or PTPN22 GC/CTLA-4 AA genotypes had 1.90-fold (95 % CI 1.02-3.49) greater risk of AS development than those with other combinations of PTPN22 and CTLA-4 genotypes. Our findings indicated that PTPN22 -1123G/C and CTLA-4 +49A/G genetic polymorphisms have a combined effect on the development of AS. 
Association of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis: a case-control study.	To investigate the association between receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in a Chinese Han population.
Association of HLA-B27 and ERAP1 with ankylosing spondylitis susceptibility in Beijing Han Chinese.	This study investigated the genetic polymorphisms of HLA-B27, together with polymorphisms on endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), and susceptibility for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in the Beijing Han population. A case-control study was carried out for 602 AS patient samples and 619 matched controls of Han Chinese. HLA-B27 genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP), and four ERAP1 SNPs (rs27037, rs27980, rs27582, and rs27434) were selected and genotyped on the Sequenom iPlex platform (Sequenom, San Diego, CA). Association analysis was performed using the likelihood ratio χ(2) test. This study identified four HLA-B27 alleles in Beijing Han AS patients, B*27:02, B*27:04, B*27:05, and B*27:07, of which B*27:05 was the most significant geographical different subtype among AS patients in Chinese. Our results confirmed that HLA-B27 was strongly associated with AS (P=1.9 × 10(-150) ), and the most strongly associated alleles were B*27:04, B*27:05, and B*27:02. Our study also confirmed a weak association between ERAP1 (rs27434) and AS. We also observed that for HLA-B*27:02 and HLA-B*27:04 positive AS patients, rs27434 and rs27582 were associated with AS. In contrast, for HLA-B27-negative and HLA-B*27:05-positive AS patients, this association was not observed. This is the first study to show that both B27 and ERAP1 are AS genetic susceptibility genes in Beijing Han. Interactions between ERAP1 and HLA-B*27:02 and B*27:04 may play an important role in the AS pathogenesis.
