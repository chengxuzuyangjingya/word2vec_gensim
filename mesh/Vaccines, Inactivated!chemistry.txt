Rapid and selective characterization of influenza virus constituents in monovalent and multivalent preparations using non-porous reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography columns.	The characterization of influenza vaccine composition has been approached through a novel methodology suitable for routine analysis. It is based on a two-stage process involving an initial sample processing step followed by analysis by reversed-phase HPLC with UV detection. The sample processing involves an initial concentration step carried out in the presence of a combination of detergents and organic solvents to enhance solubilization and ultimately to provide adequate detection. Conditions that provided fast, reproducible and selective separations of vaccine constituents were investigated by reversed-phase HPLC. The use of non-porous silica stationary phases was found to minimize carry-over and non-specific adsorption observed with conventional columns. An evaluation of separation parameters, including mobile phase composition and column temperature, allowed optimization of the selectivity of the method. The optimized method was suitable for the characterization of processed monovalent preparations (containing influenza virus constituents from a single strain). In addition, it allowed the simultaneous detection of the three influenza subtypes in trivalent vaccines in a single analysis. Several influenza constituents were detected including nucleoprotein, the highly hydrophobic matrix protein and the primary surface antigen, haemagglutinin (HA).
