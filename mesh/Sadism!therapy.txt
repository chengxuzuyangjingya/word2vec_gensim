The management aspect of psychotherapy with aggressive children.	Psychotherapy with an aggressive child may require the imposition of rather firm limitations over aspects of the patient's aggressive behavior. The nature of this management strategy is determined by the individual child's psychopathology. The management aspects of the psychotherapy with two aggressive boys are illustrated in detail. In one case, stringent limitations were imposed when it was discovered that the boy's behavior was regressive and represented an effort to sadistically control people in his environment. In the other case, the behavior was initially left almost unchallenged; this boy's aggressive and delinquent behavior reflected an effort to achieve a sense of order in an inconsistent external and potentially chaotic internal environment.
