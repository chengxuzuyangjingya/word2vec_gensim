Vitamin D antagonist, TEI-9647, inhibits osteoclast formation induced by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 from pagetic bone marrow cells.	(23S)-25-Dehydro-1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D(3)-26,23-lactone (TEI-9647) functions an antagonist of the 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3)) nuclear receptor (VDR)-mediated differentiation of human leukemia (HL-60) cells [J. Biol. Chem. 274 (1999) 16392]. We examined the effect of vitamin D antagonist, TEI-9647, on osteoclast formation induced by 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) from bone marrow cells of patients with Paget's disease. TEI-9647 itself never induced osteoclast formation even at 10(-6)M, but dose-dependently (10(-10) to 10(-6)M) inhibited osteoclast formation induced by physiologic concentrations of 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) (41 pg/ml, 10(-10)M) from bone marrow cells of patients with Paget's disease. At the same time, 10(-8)M of TEI-9647 alone did not cause 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) dependent gene expression, but almost completely suppressed TAF(II)-17, a potential coactivator of VDR and 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3)-24-hydroxylase (25-OH-D(3)-24-hydroxylase) gene expression induced by 10(-10)M 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) in bone marrow cells of patients with Paget's disease. Moreover, TEI-9647 dose-dependently inhibited bone resorption induced by 10(-9)M 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) by osteoclasts produced by RANKL and M-CSF treatment of measles virus nucleocapsid gene transduced bone marrow cells. These results suggest that TEI-9647 acts directly on osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts, and that TEI-9647 may be a novel agent to suppress the excessive bone resorption and osteoclast formation in patients with Paget's disease.
Selective inhibitors of vitamin D metabolism--new concepts and perspectives.	Levels of active vitamin D (VD) are controlled by synthesis via CYP27B1 and self-induced metabolism by CYP24A1. Unbalanced high CYP24A1 expression due to induction by diverse endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, and amplification found in various tumours, might lead to local VD deficiency, thereby causing/reinforcing disorders.
Sunscreen use: controversies, challenges and regulatory aspects.	Mismatches between skin pigmentation and modern lifestyle continue to challenge our naked skin. One of our responses to these challenges is the development and use of sunscreens. The management of sunscreens has to balance their protective effect against erythema, photocarcinogenesis and photoageing owing to the potential toxicity of the ultraviolet (UV) filters for humans and the environment. The protection against UV radiation offered by sunscreens was recently standardized in the European Union (EU) based on international harmonization of measurement techniques. Four different categories of sun protection have been implemented along with recommendations on how to use sunscreen products in order to obtain the labelled protection. The UV filters in sunscreens have long been authorized for use by the EU authority on the basis of data from studies on acute toxicity, subchronic and chronic toxicity, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, photogenotoxicity, carcinogenicity, irritation, sensitization, phototoxicity and photosensitization as well as on environmental aspects. New challenges with respect to the safety of UV filters have arisen from the banning of animal experiments for the development of cosmetics. Future debates on sunscreens are likely to focus on nanoparticles and environmental issues, along with motivation campaigns to persuade consumers to protect their skin. However, more efficient sunscreen use will also continue to raise questions on the benefit in preventing vitamin D synthesis in the skin induced by sunlight.
