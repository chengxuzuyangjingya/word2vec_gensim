Purine metabolites and pyrimidine bases in cerebrospinal fluid of children with simple febrile seizures.	Adenosine monophosphate, inosine monophosphate, inosine, adenosine, guanosine, adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, uric acid and pyrimidine bases were determined in the CSF of 18 children after simple febrile seizures and in a control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups for any of these metabolites. This suggests that simple febrile seizures neither significantly disturb the metabolism of nucleotides, nucleosides or bases, nor significantly deplete neuron adenosine triphosphate ATP levels.
