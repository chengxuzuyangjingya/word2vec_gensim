Carcinogenic potential of hycanthone in mice and hamsters.	Hycanthone was administered to Schistosoma mansoni-infected and non-infected Syrian golden hamsters and Swiss mice by intraperitoneal and intramuscular injection of amounts up to the maximum tolerated dose. No tumors attributable to treatment were observed in hamsters. In infected mice, the overall incidence of hepatomas and hepatocellular carcinomas increased from 3.4% in untreated mice to 10.6% in those treated with hycanthone. Non-infected control mice developed 0.8% of these tumors compared to 10.2% in mice treated with hycanthone. Despite the use of high dose levels of hycanthone, statistical significance was attained only with non-infected female mice injected intraperitoneally and intramuscularly with hycanthone and then only at confidence levels of 92 and 95% respectively.
