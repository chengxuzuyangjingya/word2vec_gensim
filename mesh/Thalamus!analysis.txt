Biochemical compartmentation of fish tissues. I. Brain energy reserves and its metabolic products.	The quantitative distribution of glycogen, lactate and pyruvate in the brain was studied in 4 regions of 9 fishes. The highest glycogen, lactate and pyruvate content was present in major carps followed by cat fishes and snake headed fishes. Glycogen and lactate contents were highest in the medulla oblongata while the highest pyruvate level was observed in the cerebellum. The observed differential distribution of glycogen, lactate and pyruvate in the different regions of the brain is discussed in relation to their functional differention and may depend on the nature of the diet, on the environment and growth rate, etc., of the fishes.
The distribution of immunoreactive angiotensins I and II extracted from rat brain.	A method was developed to measure immunoreactive angiotensin I and II extracted from rat brain tissue. The angiotensin-immunoreactive materials extracted from brain tissue resembled angiotensins I and II in many of their physiochemical properties. The concentration of angiotensin-immunoreactive materials was highest in extracts of pituitary, hypothalamus and thalamus. The concentrations of angiotensin-immunoreactive materials were not decreased in extracts of brain tissue from bilaterally nephrectomized rats. The concentrations of immunoreactive materials in extracts of pituitary far exceed those which could be accounted for by the blood and suggests that these endogenous peptides may regulate the neurosecretion of antidiuretic hormone.
