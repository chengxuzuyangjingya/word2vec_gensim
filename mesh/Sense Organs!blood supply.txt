Blood flow in snake infrared organs: response-induced changes in individual vessels.	In the past the microkinetics of blood flow in the infrared pit organs of pit vipers has been studied with Doppler flowmetry using various infrared stimuli such as a human hand or soldering iron at various distances, lasers of various wavelengths, etc. Quick-acting variations in blood flow were recorded, and interpreted as a cooling mechanism for avoiding afterimage in the infrared receptors. However, the Doppler measurements provided only the summation of blood flow in a number of vessels covered by the sensing probe, but did not give data on flow in individual vessels.
