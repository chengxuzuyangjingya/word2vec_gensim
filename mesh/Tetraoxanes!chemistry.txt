Influence of stereoisomer of dispiro-1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes on their binding mode with heme and on antimalarial activity: molecular docking studies.	Based on the fact that different isomers may exhibit substantial distinct activities, quantum chemical calculations and automated molecular docking simulations were carried out for 13 dispiro-1,2,4,5-tetraoxane compounds, which experimentally exist as a mixture of several isomers, to elucidate the most probable isomer(s) responsible for their antimalarial activity. The results indicate significant effects of stereoisomer on the binding mode and the activity. Moreover, the antimalarial potency of each compound can be described by the docking results. Compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9 have the most probable isomers coordinate suitably with heme iron and hence they have high activities while the most probable isomer in compounds 3 and 8 could not bind appropriately to heme yielding only moderate activities. On the other hand, the steric hindrance in compounds 11-13 prevents an approach of heme iron to peroxide bonds resulting in a devoid of antimalarial activity. However, compounds 6 and 10 with isopropyl substituents exhibit a different docking character, which is possibly caused by a limitation in molecular flexibility of the available docking technique. Our results can be used as a guideline for stereochemical control in synthesis process to improve drug's potency.
