Protein engineering of a human enzyme that hydrolyzes V and G nerve agents: design, construction and characterization.	Because of deficiencies in the present treatments for organophosphorus anticholinesterase poisoning, we are attempting to develop a catalytic scavenger that can be administered as prophylactic protection. Currently known enzymes are inadequate for this purpose because they have weak binding and slow turnover, so we are trying to make an appropriate enzyme by protein engineering techniques. One butyrylcholinesterase mutant, G117H, has the desired type of activity but reacts much too slowly. This communication describes an attempt to determine the reason for the slow reaction so that a more efficient enzyme might be designed. The results indicate that the mutation at residue 117 has resulted in a distortion of the transition state of the reaction of organophosphorus compounds with the active site serine. This information will be used to develop other mutants that avoid transition state stabilization sites.
Alteromonas prolidase for organophosphorus G-agent decontamination.	Enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of highly toxic organophosphorus compounds (OPs) are classified as organophosphorus acid anhydrolases (OPAA; EC 3.1.8.2). Recently, the genes encoding OPAA from two species of Alteromonas were cloned and sequenced. Sequence and biochemical analyses of the cloned genes and enzymes have established Alteromonas OPAAs to be prolidases (E.C. 3.4.13.9), a type of dipeptidase hydrolyzing dipeptides with a prolyl residue in the carboxyl-terminal position (X-Pro). Alteromonas prolidases hydrolyze a broad range of G-type chemical warfare (CW) nerve agents. Efforts to over-produce a prolidase from A. sp.JD6.5 with the goal of developing strategies for long-term storage and decontamination have been successfully achieved. Large-scale production of this G-agent degrading enzyme is now feasible with the availability of an over-producing recombinant cell line. Use of this enzyme for development of a safe and non-corrosive decontamination system is discussed.
Effects of pretreatment with 8018 on the toxicokinetics of soman in rabbits and distribution in mice.	The effects of 8018 [3-(2'-phenyl-2'-cyclopentyl-2'-hydroxyl-ethoxy)quinuclidine] on the elimination of soman in rabbits blood and distribution in mice brain and diaphragm were investigated using the chirasil capillary gas chromatographic analysis method. In all experiments, the concentration of P(+)soman was below the detection limit (<0.1 ng x mL(-1)). 8018 (1 mg x kg(-1), im, 10 min pre-treated) could significantly reduce the concentration of P(-)soman in rabbit blood from 53.6 +/- 13.3 to 26.2 +/- 9.70 ng x mL(-1) blood as compared to soman-treated control animal at 15 s following soman injection (43.2 microg x kg(-1), iv). Toxicokinetic parameters showed 8018 could increase clearance (CL((S))) from 20.8 +/- 1.54 to 38.2 +/- 15.3 mLx kg(-1) x s(-1) and reduce AUC of P(-)soman from 2.08 +/- 0.151 to 1.30 +/- 0.564 mg x s x L(-1). 8018 could reduce the concentration P(-)soman in diaphragm from 74.7, 70.5, 88.7 ng x g(-1) to 54.5 45.6, 50.0 ng x g(-1) at the time of 30, 90, 120 s after intoxication of soman subcutaneously vs. soman control respectively, but it had no influence on the concentration of free P(-)soman in brain. Isotope trace experiments showed that it could significantly increase the distribution amount of bound [3H]soman in mice plasma and small intestine during 0-120 min after mice received [3H]soman (0.544 GBq.119 microg x kg(-1), sc) compared to soman control group.
