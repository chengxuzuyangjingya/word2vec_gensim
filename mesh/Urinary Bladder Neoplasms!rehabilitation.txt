The emotional problems of patients with bladder cancer.	In recent years the quality of survival has become a more dominant factor in our treatment and management of patients with cancer. As a result, it has become necessary to think in terms of a multidisciplinary approach to total rehabilitation. A part of this rehabilitation is of necessity determined by the emotional responses that patients exhibit to their disease and to its treatment. A useful model that has been applied to patients with other diseases and to patients with other types of cancer seems equally applicable to patients with bladder cancer. In my work with cancer patients I became aware that, after the initial fear of death was dealt with, the patients all responded to their dilemma with stereotyped and predictable responses (emotional patterns of behavior). It was apparent that these responses were determined by the degree to which the patient's life style was altered by the disease and/or treatment.
