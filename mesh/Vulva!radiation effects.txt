Anastomosis of free flaps to the inferior epigastric artery]	The inferior epigastric vessels are a reliable and easily accessible vascular pedicle for free tissue transplantation to the perineum, genital area, and the abdominal wall. Two cases serve to illustrate the procedure: the first involves a post-radiation ulcer following recurring carcinoma of the vulva with loss of the symphysis; the second involves a reconstruction of the abdominal wall employing a two-fold latissimus dorsi flap in a patient with malignant fibrous histiocytoma.
