Comparison of the actions of 5-fluorouracil and ftorafur in Escherichia coli.	The actions of 5-fluorouracil (FU) and Ftorafur (NCS 148958) were compared in Escherichia coli B3 to determine if Ftorafur can act in ways other than through the production of FU. Very high concentrations of Ftorafur relative to FU were necessary to achieve a comparable inhibition of cell growth. Inhibition by both agents could be reversed by uracil. An FU-resistant strain and an Ftorafur-resistant strain were isolated and found to be cross-resistant to Ftorafur and FU, respectively.
