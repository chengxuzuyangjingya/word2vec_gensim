Genetic analyses of two cases of Werner's syndrome.	We report two cases of Werner's syndrome (WS). First, a 42-year-old Japanese man was referred on suspicion of systemic sclerosis (SSc) because of scleroderma-like skin atrophy and foot ulcers. Second, a 51-year-old woman with malignant fibrous histiocytoma was referred on suspicion of premature aging syndrome. Because both patients had many typical manifestations compatible with WS, we made a clinical diagnosis of WS. Genetic analyses revealed a homozygous mutation, an A deletion at nucleotide 3677 of WS gene (WRN) in the first case and a homozygous mutation, a G to C substitution at one base upstream of exon 26 of WRN in the second case. Both mutations were consistent with those previously reported in Japanese WS patients.
Clinical two-photon microendoscopy.	Two-photon medical imaging has found its way into dermatology as an excellent method for noninvasive skin cancer detection without need of contrast agents as well as for in situ drug screening of topically-applied cosmetical and pharmaceutical components. There is an increasing demand to apply the multiphoton technology also for deep-tissue skin imaging as well as for intracorporal imaging. We report on the first clinical use of multiphoton endoscopes, in particular of a miniaturized rigid two-photon GRIN lens endoscope. The microendoscope was attached to the multiphoton tomograph DermaInspect and employed to detect the extracellular matrix proteins collagen and elastin in the human dermis of volunteers and patients with ulcera by in vivo second harmonic generation and in vivo two-photon autofluorescence.
Impact of systemic sclerosis on occupational and professional activity with attention to patients with digital ulcers.	To evaluate the impact of systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) and digital ulcers (DUs) on daily living and professional activities.
