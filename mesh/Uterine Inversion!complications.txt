Pregnancy outcome after operative correction of puerperal uterine inversion.	Uterine inversion is an uncommon but life-threatening obstetric emergency. A review of the approaches to correct uterine inversion is presented. In cases where time has elapsed between delivery and presentation, the inversion ring may have become too tight to allow manual reposition of the fundus. In such cases, it has to be divided by a vertical incision. In subsequent pregnancy, antenatal care should include placental localization and planning for an elective Caesarean Section. The outcome of future pregnancies may be complicated by placenta accreta and massive haemorrhage.
