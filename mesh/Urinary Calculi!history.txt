Strong inference in mechanistic urolithiasis: a tribute to Birdwell Finlayson's biophysical contributions.	The career of Birdwell Finlayson was distinguished by his continual efforts at casting problems he encountered in urolithiasis in terms of relevant physical theory. His extensive background in biophysics qualified him uniquely for this task. He employed a process called "strong inference" as much as possible; this process was derived from a 1964 essay by John R. Platt, and it appears repeatedly as a guiding principle in Finlayson's research.
The history of urologic surgery: from reeds to robotics.	Bladder function has interested man since prehistoric times. Evidence of health and well being was often measured from observation of urine. When urologic function was impaired, the extent of the ensuing pain often called for dramatic measures to obtain relief. The practice of urology has advanced substantially since the days when reeds were used to alleviate obstruction of the bladder. This article presents a brief historical overview of urology and the strides made in prostate surgery with modern technology.
