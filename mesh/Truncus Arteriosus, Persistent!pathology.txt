Common arterial trunk associated with absence of one atrioventricular connexion.	An unusual case of common arterial trunk is described. The right pulmonary artery is supplied by the ascending trunk and the left pulmonary artery arises via an arterial duct from the left brachiocephalic trunk. Although common arterial trunk can exist with any atrioventricular connexion, the absence of one atrioventricular connexion (tricuspid atresia) is the other rarity of this case.
