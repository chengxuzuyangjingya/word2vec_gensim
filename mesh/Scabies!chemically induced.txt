Crusted (Norwegian) scabies induced by use of topical corticosteroids and treated successfully with ivermectin.	Crusted scabies is mainly observed in children with immunosuppression or mental illness. Treatment is very difficult, and relapse is frequent after topical scabicidal therapy. We describe a case of crusted scabies, induced by long-term application of a topical corticosteroid, relapsing after topical treatment and dramatically improved by ivermectin. We suggest that ivermectin is a safe and effective alternative therapy for the treatment of severe Sarcoptes scabiei infestation in children unresponsive to conventional treatment.
Crusted Norwegian scabies, an opportunistic infection, with tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis.	Crusted Norwegian scabies is an extremely rare hyperkeratotic variant of scabies infestation. We report herein a case of crusted scabies in a woman with severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated by tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody blocking the interleukin-6 receptor.
