The expression of lymphocytic function-associated antigen determined by IKO-11 monoclonal antibodies in patients with nephroblastoma and neuroblastoma]	The importance of NK-cells was shown in 12 patients with nephroblastoma and 10 patients with neuroblastoma using ICO-11 monoclonal antibodies. The numbers of circulating LFA-1+ cells were shown to be different in the untreated and treated patients. A certain regular influence of antitumour therapy on the amount of circulating LFA-1+ cells was established.
Immunological reactivity in children with Wilms' tumor.	Cellular immune reactivity was investigated in 49 newly diagnosed children with Wilms' tumor and compared to age-matched control. The level of total T (T4 degrees) and B lymphocytes was normal while the relative number of T lymphocytes with high affinity receptors for sheep erythrocytes (T29 degrees) was significantly decreased in the patients studied. The lymphocyte response to PHA in vitro was diminished but PHA-induced lymphokine production was not altered. The depression of T29 degrees level and lymphocyte reactivity to PHA was associated with high grade tumor rather than with the clinical stage. Lymphocytes of 42-47% patients reacted with autochthonous and allogeneic KCl tumor extracts in the migration inhibition test and the degree of reactivity was related to the histological differentiation of the tumor.
