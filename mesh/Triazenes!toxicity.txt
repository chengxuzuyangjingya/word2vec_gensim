Genetical relationship between resistance to insecticides and procarcinogens in two Drosophila populations.	Two Drosophila populations, one resistant and the other susceptible to several insecticides, were examined for response to several alkaryltriazenes (2,4,6-Cl3-PDMT; 3-PyDMT; 3-PyDET) and to DMN, DEN and AM. Hikone R (HR) males developed relative resistance to both mutation induction and cell killing by the triazenes, whereas Berlin K (BK) males showed increased tolerance to DMN, DEN, and AM. When F1 hybrid males from the two strains were treated with 2,4,6-Cl3-PDMT, the yield of recessive lethal mutations in the heterozygotes was nearly half of that found in homozygotes from the susceptible strain Berlin K. These findings indicate that in Drosophila metabolism of procarcinogens is controlled by multiple-gene systems located on several chromosomes. An extremely divergent response of the two genotypes was found following treatment with 3-PyDET; this triazene acts as a potent mutagen in BK males but is hardly mutagenic when tested in strain HR.
