Digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Work load and financial implications for a neuroradiology department.	A four year study has been undertaken into the effects on the workload and cost implications of the introduction of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in a large United Kingdom teaching hospital. The increase in workload has been entirely due to the ability to perform intravenous angiography. DSA is cheaper than conventional angiography if more than 210 cases are undertaken each year. This difference is accounted for by the reduced use of X-ray film. However, intravenous angiography is more expensive because of the use of large volumes of nonionic medium.
