Migrating and recurrent superficial phlebitis and Takayasu's disease (apropos of a case)]	This case of recurrent migratory superficial phlebitis is reported because of the highly unusual nature of the lesion observed. The picture was dominated by periphlebitis with inflammatory granuloma, giant cells and elastophagia. When the condition had been present for sixteen months, an aortic arch syndrome developed in an inflammatory context. In this light, various auto-immunological etiologies were considered, among them Takayashu's arteritis of which, in the author's opinion, this would be the first case to be combined with venopathy.
Arterial insufficiency of the upper extremity with special reference to Takayasu's arteritis and Buerger's disease.	The occlusive arterial lesions of the upper extremity in Takayasu's arteritis is estimated in 72.3% in the left and in 45.6% in the right subclavian arteries, respectively. Buerger's disease also involves the arteries distal to the elbow and the digital arteries in about 22% of total cases. In Takayasu's arteritis, the surgical treatment for the upper extremity ischemia is rarely indicated, except for the cases with aneurysm, because the occlusive lesion involves exclusively the aorta and its branches, and severe ischemia of the upper digital arteries in Buerger's disease frequently causes severe ischemic symptoms of hand and fingers, such as rest pain, trophic changes and tissue loss. Therefore, the surgical treatment, including upper thoracic sympathectomy and amputation, is mandatory in some cases.
