Thermal inactivation of tryptophan synthase. Stabilization by protein-protein interaction and protein-ligand interaction.	This study investigates effects of ligands on thermal inactivation of the tryptophan synthase alpha and beta 2 subunits alone and in the alpha 2 beta 2 complex. Addition of pyridoxal phosphate to the apo-beta 2 subunit increases the temperature of one-half inactivation (Ti) from 52 to 77 degrees C. Ligands that promote association of the alpha and holo-beta 2 subunits markedly stabilize the more temperature-labile alpha subunit in the alpha 2 beta 2 complex from irreversible thermal denaturation. The combination of a beta 2 subunit ligand (L-serine) with an alpha subunit ligand (alpha-glycerol 3-phosphate) raises the inactivation temperature (Ti) of the alpha subunit in the holo-alpha 2 beta 2 complex from 54 to 66 degrees C. In contrast, values of Ti for inactivation of the alpha and beta subunits in the holo-alpha 2 beta 2 complex are more similar to respective values for the isolated alpha subunit (50 degrees C) and holo-beta 2 subunit (77 degrees C). Surprisingly, the addition of L-serine results in a larger decrease in the Ti of the beta 2 subunit in the holo-alpha 2 beta 2 complex (78 degrees C-->64 degrees C) than in Ti of the holo-beta 2 subunit alone (77 degrees C-->71 degrees C). The observation that ligands have different effects on the isolated and associated subunits provides evidence that the alpha and beta 2 subunits do not fully dissociate during thermal inactivation of the alpha 2 beta 2 complex at pH 7.8 and at approximately 0.1 ionic strength. Our results demonstrate that linkage between protein-ligand interactions and protein-protein interactions affects the conformational stability of the tryptophan synthase alpha 2 beta 2 complex.
Tryptophan synthase mutations that alter cofactor chemistry lead to mechanism-based inactivation.	Mutations in the pyridoxal phosphate binding site of the tryptophan synthase beta subunit (S377D and S377E) alter cofactor chemistry [Jhee, K.-H., et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 11417-11422]. We now report that the S377D, S377E, and S377A beta2 subunits form alpha2 beta2 complexes with the alpha subunit and activate the alpha subunit-catalyzed cleavage of indole 3-glycerol phosphate. The apparent Kd for dissociation of the alpha and beta subunits is unaffected by the S377A mutation but is increased up to 500-fold by the S377D and S377E mutations. Although the three mutant alpha2 beta2 complexes exhibit very low activities in beta elimination and beta replacement reactions catalyzed at the beta site in the presence of Na+, the activities and spectroscopic properties of the S377A alpha2 beta2 complex are partially repaired by addition of Cs+. The S377D and S377E alpha2 beta2 complexes, unlike the wild-type and S377A alpha2 beta2 complexes and the mutant beta2 subunits, undergo irreversible substrate-induced inactivation by L-serine or by beta-chloro-L-alanine. The rates of inactivation (kinact) are similar to the rates of catalysis (kcat). The partition ratios are very low (kcat/kinact = 0.25-3) and are affected by alpha subunit ligands and monovalent cations. The inactivation product released by alkali was shown by HPLC and by fluorescence, absorption, and mass spectroscopy to be identical to a compound previously synthesized from pyridoxal phosphate and pyruvate. We suggest that alterations in the cofactor chemistry that result from the engineered Asp377 in the active site of the beta subunit may promote the mechanism-based inactivation.
