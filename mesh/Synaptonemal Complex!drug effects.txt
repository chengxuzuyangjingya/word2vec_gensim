Synaptonemal complex alterations in X-irradiated and in oestrogen-treated mice: a comparative study.	Synaptonemal complexes (SCs) were analysed in male NMRI mice either X-irradiated or treated with oestradiol benzoate (E2B). Animals 30 days old underwent a single X-ray exposure of either 5, 7.5 or 10 Gy and were killed at different times after exposure, i.e., 24 h, 1, 4, 12 and 16 weeks. E2B was injected daily to adult mice from day 30 to day 60 or up to day 90 of age. Oestradiol was also administered during the neonatal period and animals were examined on days 28, 60 and 90 of age. Different SC alterations were found in X-irradiated and in E2B-treated mice. SC lesions were rare in oestrogen-treated adult mice. Among SC anomalies, asynapsis and fragmentation of SC were common lesions. However, the former was more frequent in E2B-treated mice, whereas the latter was more frequent in X-irradiated mice. Quadri- or multi-valents, bridges between bivalents, rings and loops were exclusively encountered in the latter, whereas heterotelomeric associations seemed to be specific in E2B-treated animals. The mechanisms of the different SC lesions are discussed.
