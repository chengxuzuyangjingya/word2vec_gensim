Inducing effect of plant cells on nitrogenase activity by Spirillum and Rhizobium in vitro.	Eleven different plant cell tissue cultures of both legume and non-legume origin have been grown in direct association, and in separate but close proximal association with both Spirillum lipoferum and Rhizobium sp. 32H1. Basic similarities were found in the nutritional requirement for the induction of nitrogenase activity (C2H2) in both organisms. In the absence of plant cell cultures both organisms need to be provided with a pentose sugar and a tricarboxylic acid to induce high levels of nitrogen-fixing activity. Plant cell callus tissue appears only capable of supplying the tricarboxylic acid to induce high levels of nitrogen-fixing activity. Plant cell callus tissue appears only capable of supplying the tricarboxylic acids needed but not the sugar component. The plant tissue, however, seems able to activate certain carbohydrates, which in themselves are incapable of substituting for the pentose additive.
