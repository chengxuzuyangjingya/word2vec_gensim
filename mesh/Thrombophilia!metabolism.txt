Fibrinogen-like protein 2/fibroleukin prothrombinase contributes to tumor hypercoagulability via IL-2 and IFN-gamma.	To examine the role of Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (fgl2)/fibroleukin in tumor development. Fgl2 has been reported to play a vital role in the pathogenesis in MHV-3 (mouse hepatitis virus) induced fulminant and severe hepatitis, spontaneous abortion, allo- and xeno- graft rejection by mediating "immune coagulation".
