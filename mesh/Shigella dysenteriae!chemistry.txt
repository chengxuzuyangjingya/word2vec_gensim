Heme inhibits the DNA binding properties of the cytoplasmic heme binding protein of Shigella dysenteriae (ShuS).	Heme uptake and utilization by pathogenic bacteria are critical for virulence and disease, since heme and heme proteins are a major source of iron within the host. Although the role of outer membrane heme receptors in this process has been extensively characterized at the genetic and biochemical level, the role of the cytoplasmic heme binding proteins is not yet clear. The Shigella dysenteriae cytoplasmic heme binding protein, ShuS, has previously been shown to promote utilization of heme as an iron source at low to moderate heme concentrations and to protect against heme toxicity at high heme concentrations. Herein, we provide evidence that ShuS of S. dysenteriae sequesters DNA non-sequence-specifically with a binding affinity of 3.6 microM as determined by fluorescence anisotropy studies. The ability to bind DNA was observed to be restricted to the apoprotein only. The molecular mass of the apo-ShuS-DNA complex was estimated to be approximately 700 kDa by size exclusion chromatography. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that apo-ShuS forms aggregates in the presence of DNA and provides a scaffolding matrix from which DNA is observed to loop outward. The AFM images of apo-ShuS-DNA complexes were strikingly similar to the AFM images of the stress-induced Escherichia coli protein, Dps, when complexed with DNA; however, unlike the Dps protein, ShuS failed to protect DNA against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. Since free heme can generate reactive oxygen species which are damaging to cellular DNA, the ability of ShuS to physically sequester DNA may provide a molecular basis for its role in preventing toxicity associated with high heme concentrations.
Structural relation of the antigenic polysaccharides of Escherichia coli O40, Shigella dysenteriae type 9, and E. coli K47.	O-polysaccharides were isolated from the lipopolysaccharides of Escherichia coli O40 and Shigella dysenteriae type 9 and studied by chemical analyses along with (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. The following new structure of the O-polysaccharide of E. coli O40 was established: -->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-Manp-(1-->4)-alpha-D-Galp-(1-->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1--> TheO-polysaccharide structure of S. dysenteriae type 9 established earlier was revised and found to be identical to the reported structure of the capsular polysaccharide of E. coli K47 and to differ from that of the E. coli O40 polysaccharide in the presence of a 3,4-linked pyruvic acid acetal having the (R)-configuration (RPyr): -->2)-beta-D-Galp3,4(RPyr)-(1-->4)-beta-D-Manp-(1-->4)-alpha-D-Galp-(1-->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->
Synthesis of di- to penta-saccharides related to the O-specific polysaccharide of Shigella dysenteriae type 1, and their nuclear magnetic resonance study.	The syntheses of oligosaccharide fragments of the O-specific polysaccharide of the lipopolysaccharide of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 are described, including disaccharides methyl O-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1-->2)-alpha-D-galactopyranoside (1), and methyl O-(2-deoxy-2-propionamido-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1-->3)-alpha-L- rhamnopyranoside (2), trisaccharide methyl O-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->3)-O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D- glucopyranosyl)-(1-->3)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (3), tetrasaccharide methyl O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-O-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->3)- O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1-->3)-alpha-L-rhamno -pyranoside (4), and pentasaccharide methyl O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->3)-O-alpha-L- rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-O-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl- (1-->3)-O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1-->3)-alpha-L- rhamnopyranoside (5). The following monosaccharide building blocks were used as starting compounds: methyl 6-O-tert-butyldiphenylsilyl-3,4-O-isopropylidene-alpha-D-galact opy ranoside (8), methyl 3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-2-O-(4-methoxybenzyl)-1-thio-beta-D- galactopyranoside (11), methyl 3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-azido-2-deoxy-1-thio-alpha- D-glucopyranoside (16), methyl 2-azido-4,6-O-benzylidene-2-deoxy-1-thio-alpha-D- glucopyranoside (18), methyl 2,4-di-O-benzyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (21), methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-benzoyl-1-thio-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (22), 2,3,4-tri-O-benzoyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl bromide (23), and methyl 4-O-benzyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (24). Nuclear magnetic resonance data indicate that oligosaccharides 4 and 5 partially mimic the conformation of the O-specific polysaccharide of S. dys. type 1.
