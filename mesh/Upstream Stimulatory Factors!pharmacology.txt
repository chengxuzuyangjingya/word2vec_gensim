Regulation of IL-10 expression by upstream stimulating factor (USF-1) in glioma-associated microglia.	Understanding the local CNS immune response to neoplasms is essential in the development of immune-based treatments for malignant brain tumors. Using rodent glioma models, we have recently found tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (MG/MP) to be less responsive to known MG/MP activators such as CpG, LPS and IFN-gamma. To understand the mechanism of MG/MP suppression, nuclear extracts from rodent intracranial C6 gliomas, C6 glioma-associated MG/MP, normal brain, and normal MG/MP were obtained and studied using Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). Among the nuclear factors studied (AP-1, IRF, USF-1 and Stat-1) only USF-1, which is constitutively expressed in most cells, was down-regulated in tumor-associated MG/MP, but not normal MG/MP. Because tumor-associated MG/MP had higher expression of IL-10 (but not TNF-alpha or TGF-beta), we evaluated the role of USF-1 on IL-10 expression. siRNA mediated inhibition of USF-1 expression in primary MG/MP cultures resulted in up-regulation of IL-10 mRNA but not TNF-alpha or TGF-beta. These findings suggest that USF-1 may play a role in IL-10 regulation in MG/MP in brain tumors.
