Safety features and alerts in electronic patient medication record systems used in community pharmacy in England: an exploratory study.	Safety features embedded in electronic Patient Medication Record (ePMR) systems alert users about clinical hazards and errors in prescribed medicines during order entry. To date there has been little research about how these systems, their safety features and alerts are used to support practice; and how they are included in work processes in community pharmacies in England, UK. This study aimed to explore stakeholders' views and experiences regarding the safety features and alerts in ePMR systems; and how they might better support pharmacists and their team in practice.
