The Grellier twins, Norman (1886-1949) and Bernard (1886-1957), radiologists of East Sussex.	Identical twins Bernard and Norman Grellier (born Epsom, 1886) attended Epsom College before entering Dental School at the Royal Dental Hospital of London in 1904, graduating in 1910. Then they trained in medicine at Charing Cross Hospital. Bernard graduated in 1913 and Norman in 1915. In 1915 they joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC), serving to the end of World War I (WWI), each being awarded the Military Cross for gallantry. After WWI, they trained as radiologists and moved to St Leonards-on-Sea in West Sussex, taking up Consultant posts at the Royal East Sussex Hospital and the Municipal Hospital in Hastings, and the Eversfield Chest Hospital in St Leonards. In 1940 they rejoined the RAMC as radiologists, serving throughout World War II. They remained unmarried, devoted to each other, to their practice and to their loves of model engineering and flying, the latter nearly causing their deaths in an air crash in 1936.
