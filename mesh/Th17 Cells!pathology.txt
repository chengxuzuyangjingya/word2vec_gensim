Murine tumor necrosis factor α-induced adipose-related protein (tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 9) deficiency leads to arthritis via interleukin-6 overproduction with enhanced NF-κB, STAT-3 signaling, and dysregulated apoptosis of macrophages.	To elucidate the role of tumor necrosis factor α-induced adipose-related protein (TIARP; or tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 9 [TNFAIP-9]) in the development and pathogenesis of arthritis.
