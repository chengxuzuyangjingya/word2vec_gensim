Methods to optimize recruitment and retention to an exercise study in Chinese immigrants.	To counter pervasive disparities in healthcare and guide public health prevention programs, culturally sensitive recruitment and retention strategies for Chinese immigrants participating in health-related research studies are needed.
A Tai Chi exercise programme improved exercise behaviour and reduced blood pressure in outpatients with hypertension.	This two-group pretest and posttest quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a Tai Chi exercise programme on exercise behaviour and blood pressure (BP) in outpatients with hypertension. The experimental group (n = 27) received the Yang-style Tai Chi exercise programme three times a week for 8 weeks. The control group (n = 31) received routine care with no Tai Chi exercise. Exercise behaviour and exercise time using Routine Health Care Behaviour scale and BP were assessed at baseline and 8 weeks. The experimental group had a significant improvement on exercise behaviour (t = 2.11, P < 0.001) and exercise time (t = 1.44, P = 0.003), and a significant reduction in systolic BP (t = 2.57, P <â€‰ 0.001) and diastolic BPs (t = 2.86, P < 0.001) compared with those of the control group. Tai Chi is an inexpensive and viable exercise and can improve exercise behaviour and BP control in outpatients with hypertension. Tai Chi exercise might offer outpatients with hypertension additional options, such as an adjunct to formal cardiac rehabilitation or as an exercise alternative in their management of hypertension. Nursing staff can easily learn and incorporate this exercise in patient education or care planning in the care of patients with hypertension in outpatient settings.
