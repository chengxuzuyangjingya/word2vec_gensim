Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (gelatinase B) is selectively elevated in CSF during relapses and stable phases of multiple sclerosis.	Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of endopeptidases capable of enzymatic digestion of subendothelial basement membrane and other components of the extracellular matrix. Expression of MMP-2, -3, -7 and -9 is increased around multiple sclerosis plaques and in brain tissue in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. To measure quantitatively the expression of these MMPs and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMP-1 and -2), we analysed samples from 52 patients with relapsing-remitting and primary progressive multiple sclerosis by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and substrate-gel electrophoresis (zymography). MMP-9 was increased over controls in 100% of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis cases, with similar levels detected in relapses and clinically stable phases of disease. In primary progressive multiple sclerosis, MMP-9 was increased in 57% of CSF samples, but concentrations were below those encountered in the relapsing-remitting form. The selective upregulation of MMP-9 suggests that T-cells and macrophages invading the brain parenchyma and the CSF space are the predominant source of MMP-9 in multiple sclerosis. TIMPs and other MMPs (MMP-2 and -3) were not upregulated or not detectable (MMP-7) in CSF of patients with relapsing-remitting and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. The sustained increase of MMP-9 in clinically stable multiple sclerosis supports the concept that multiple sclerosis is associated with ongoing proteolysis that may result in progressive tissue damage. The selective inhibition of MMP-9 could be a useful approach for the prevention of disease progression in multiple sclerosis.
