Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting analyses of ureaplasmas isolated from dogs.	To define the antigenic relatedness among unspeciated ureaplasma strains isolated from dogs, four canine ureaplasma isolates representing four serotypes were compared with the five type strains of the established species in Genus Ureaplasma by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Although all the strains showed distinct electrophoretic patterns by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the Western blotting patterns were much more distinct. By Western blotting, the five type strains of established species reacted strongly with homologous antisera and showed slight cross reactions with heterologous antisera. However canine strains which showed little cross reactions with the established Ureaplasma species showed a variety of cross reactions among the four canine serotypes used.
