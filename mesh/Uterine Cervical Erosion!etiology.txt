Pathogenetic characteristics of cervical erosion in puerperae]	A study of 72 cervical biopsy specimens from puerperants revealed several pathogenetic features of endocervicitis, glandular ectropions, and authentic erosions. In particular, pseudoerosions were the result of excessive cervical gland hyperplasia that combined, in nearly all cases, with decidual transformation and chronic stromal inflammation. Ectropions were most likely to have been due to inversion of a moderately hyperplastic mucosa during delivery. In contrast, true erosions developed where the stratified squamous epithelium was hyperkeratotic and atrophic, and were often complicated by acute cervicitis.
