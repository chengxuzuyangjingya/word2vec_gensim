Multivessel percutaneous treatment of Takayasu arteritis.	We report the case of a female patient with obstructive lesions in the right and left carotid, right renal, left subclavian and left common iliac arteries which were percutaneously treated.
Takayasu's arteritis progression on anti-TNF biologics: a case series.	Takayasu's arteritis (TA) is a rare granulomatous vasculitic disease that affects the aorta and its major branches. Recent studies have suggested that anti-TNFα biological therapies are highly effective in treating TA refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapy. We describe two patients with TA: one with progressive TA despite management with two different anti-TNFα agents, infliximab and adalimumab, and another who developed TA while treated with infliximab for the management of pre-existing Crohn's disease. From our observations, we believe that a multicentered randomized study should be designed to assess the extent of resistance to these agents when different therapeutic doses are employed for managing TA.
Treatment of chronic idiopathic systemic vasculitides.	The following review is intended to summarize currently accepted, as well as newly appreciated therapies for the chronic systemic vasculitides. In recent years, a great deal has been learned about enhancement and inhibition of immunoinflammatory phenomena. Biological, immunomodulatory agents with focussed actions are just beginning to be tested in the clinical setting. However, until these promising approaches have been more thoroughly evaluated, it will continue to be necessary to cautiously titrate broadly immunosuppressive medications for the treatment of these disorders.
