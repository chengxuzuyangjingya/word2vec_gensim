X-ray characterization of self-assembled long-chain phosphatidylcholine/bile salt/silica mesostructured films with nanoscale homogeneity.	A bile salt (sodium taurodeoxycholate, NaTDC) was used to prevent phase separation between silica and lipid in self-assembled long-chain diacyl phosphatidylcholine/SiO(2) films. Phase diagrams for NaTDC/didecanoyl phosphatidylcholine/SiO(2) and NaTDC/egg phosphatidylcholine/SiO(2) films were investigated through grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering at a synchrotron source.
