Amniotic band syndrome as a cause of fetal malformations. Steroids not to be regarded as the cause]	Term deliveries of babies with amniotic band syndrome (ABS) occur approximately at a rate of 1:5000 to 1:15,000 of all cases. The ABS can be found after obviously quite normal pregnancies as well as in cases with previous mechanical stimuli, such as amniocentesis or after attempted artificial termination of pregnancy by mechanically induced lesions.
