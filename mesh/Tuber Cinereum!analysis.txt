Immunocytochemical localization of somatostatin-containing neurons in the brain of Rana temporaria.	The brain of the frog Rana temporaria was studied at the light microscopic level with the use of a double immunocytochemical staining method. The telencephalon, diencephalon and rhombencephalon contain somatostatin perikarya and fibers. In the telencephalon, the location of the somatostatin neurons largely corresponds to that of mammals. In the hypothalamus, the somatostatin perikarya are located in and near the magnocellular preoptic nucleus and also in the pars ventralis of the tuber cinereum. Like the somatostatin neurons of the rat hypothalamus, they form a separate subpopulation, different from the neurons producing neurohypophysial hormones. In Rana, somatostatin neurons are also present in (as well as in the vicinity of) the subfornical organ, in the thalamus, the tectum opticum, the interpeduncular nucleus and the caudal end of the roof of the calamus scriptorius. A precise localization of the perikarya of most somatostatin fibers, including those found in the median eminence and the neural lobe, was not attained.
