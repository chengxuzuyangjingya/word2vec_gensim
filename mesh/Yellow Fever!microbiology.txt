Human fatal yellow fever. Immunohistochemical detection of viral antigens in the liver, kidney and heart.	An immunohistochemical method to detect yellow fever antigen was developed using immune sera from rabbits and hamsters and hyperimmune ascitic fluid from mice. A search for the antigen was carried out in liver, kidney and heart in three fatal cases of yellow fever. In the liver it was present in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, Councilman bodies and Kupffer cells. Yellow fever antigen was also detected in renal tubular epithelium and in groups of myocardial fibers. These findings suggest that viral replication occurs at sites other than the liver. Since yellow fever shares many features with other haemorrhagic fevers the use of immunohistochemistry can impart a significant improvement in the accuracy of its histopathological diagnosis.
