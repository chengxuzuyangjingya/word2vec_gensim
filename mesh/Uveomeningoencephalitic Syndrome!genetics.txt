FGFR1OP tagSNP but not CCR6 polymorphisms are associated with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome in Chinese Han.	Polymorphisms of the CC chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) and FGFR10P tagSNP (locus close to CCR6) at 6q27 have recently been reported to be associated with the susceptibility to several immune-related diseases. This study was designed to determine the association of CCR6 and FGFR10P (tag)SNPs with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, an autoimmune disease directed against melanocytes, in two independent Chinese Han populations.
Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease in identical twins.	Certain aspects in the development of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease are documented, and immunogenetic studies have revealed a high relevance of some HLA types. Roles of possible environmental factors in disease onset are not fully understood, however.
