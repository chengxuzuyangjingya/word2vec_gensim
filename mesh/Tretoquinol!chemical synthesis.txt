Synthesis, beta-adrenergic activity, and platelet antiaggregatory activity of a positional isomer of trimetoquinol: 1-(2',4',5'-trimethoxybenzyl)-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4,-tetrahydroisoquinoline.	A positional isomer of trimetoquinol (1), 1-(2',4',5'-trimethoxybenzyl)-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (3), was synthesized and found to possess less beta-adrenergic activity than 1 in isolated guinea pig atrial and tracheal preparations. The analogue 3 was an effective antiaggregatory agent in human and rabbit platelet-rich plasma preparations, while 1 was effective only as an inhibitor of arachidonic acid induced aggregation in human platelets. These findings indicate that both qualitative and quantitative differences in biological activity have occurred as a result of changing the position of the methoxy groups on the 1-benzyl substituent of 1.
