Pectoralis major rupture in the elderly: clinical and sonographic findings.	We describe clinical and sonographic features of pectoralis major rupture in the elderly, which is relatively rare and unknown. Patients presented with a large pectoral ecchymosis extending to the axilla, chest wall, breast and arm. The pectoral area was sensitive, sometimes with a visible and palpable defect in the axilla. Ultrasound examination showed a large hypoechoic, well-circumscribed structure representing a hematoma within the pectoralis major muscle, partially replacing the normal echo muscle pattern. Ultrasonography is a useful, low cost diagnostic tool, and is recommended in the investigation of pectoralis major rupture in the elderly.
Ultrasonography as a diagnostic modality in acromioclavicular joint pathologies.	Ultrasound is useful in detecting acromioclavicular pathologies in cases of trauma, inflammations and degenerative changes.
