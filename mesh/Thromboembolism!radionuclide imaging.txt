Platelet imaging of thromboembolism. Natural history of postoperative deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism illustrated using the 111In-labelled platelet-specific monoclonal antibody, P256.	Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary thromboembolic disease are difficult to diagnose, particularly following surgery. This report demonstrates the use of 111In-labelled platelet-specific monoclonal antibody, P256 Fab', for the diagnosis and study of the time course of thromboembolic disease in a patient following total hip replacement.
Platelets labeled with oxine complexes of Tc-99m and In-111. Part 2. Localization of experimentally induced vascular lesions.	Using rabbit platelets harvested and labeled with either Tc-99m or In-111 oxine as described in Part 1, we have successfully imaged experimentally induced fresh venous thrombi and newly injured arterial intima. Visualization of lesions up to 6 hr old is striking. Thrombi and arterial damage 24 hr old, however, were usually not imaged successfully; nor were preformed platelet-poor arterial emboli. The varying rates of platelet deposition in vascular lesions of different ages and types account for these observations. Should human cells prove as effective, widespread clinical application is anticipated.
