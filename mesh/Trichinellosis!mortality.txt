Reviews on trichinellosis (I): renal involvement.	Besides cardiac and neurological complications of trichinellosis, renal involvement is the most important as regards the cases published and discussed in literature and is generally characteristic of the severe forms of the disease. This article focuses exclusively on the renal disturbances that may occur in this parasitic illness and includes a synopsis of published cases. Our primary goal was to increase the awareness of infectious diseases specialists, nephrologists, and general practitioners about these complications with possible fatal outcome. To our knowledge, this is the first international review dedicated to this topic. Cases for which enough details were available have been analyzed, and the results indicated that the mean age of the affected patients was 31.6 years, with a slightly male predominance (56.2%). The fatality rate was 26.1%. Proteinuria was detected in 84.8% of cases, hematuria in 30.4%, and casts were observed in urine specimens from 23.9% of patients. Renal failure was evidenced in 8.7% of patients, whereas renal lesions were found by biopsy or necropsy in 43.5% of cases. Of the routine laboratory parameters that are relevant for trichinellosis, mean eosinophil count was 32.2% and mean leukocyte count was 17,312 cells/Î¼L. Finally, we emphasize on the necessity of establishing an early and correct diagnosis of trichinellosis to avoid later and severe complications. Additionally, implementation of public health and food safety prophylactic measures against the disease must represent an immediate priority for the affected regions.
