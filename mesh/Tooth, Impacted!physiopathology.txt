Effect of lower third molars on the incidence of mandibular angle and condylar fractures.	Numerous previous studies already have proven that mandibles with a third molar are significantly more susceptible to angle fracture by external force. Similarly, other data suggest that the absence of a third molar increases the risk of condylar fracture, while concurrently decreasing the risk of angular fracture. We attempt to characterize the effect of a third molar on the incidence of mandibular angle and condylar fractures.
The occlusal and functional rehabilitation of a lower canine in complete osseous inclusion]	The aim of this paper is to show an occlusal and functional rehabilitation of a lower canine tooth in total osseous inclusion by means of surgical and orthodontic therapy. This rehabilitation is very important for mastication and for the correct function of the temporomandibular joint.
