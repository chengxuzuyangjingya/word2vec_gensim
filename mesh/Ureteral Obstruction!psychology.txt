Prospective evaluation of health related quality of life for pediatric patients with ureteropelvic junction obstruction.	Clinical practices are increasingly proposing health related quality of life measures for informed treatment decisions. Dismembered pyeloplasty is an accepted standard therapy for ureteropelvic junction obstruction. This study evaluates health related quality of life in patients with ureteropelvic junction obstruction undergoing pyeloplasty. Patients have perceived it helpful in communicating health care needs to physicians. We believe this is the first study to use child self and parent reports prospectively in ureteropelvic junction obstruction. The goals of the study were to document baseline preoperative health related quality of life assessments, differences between parent and child assessments at given intervals, differences in preoperative and postoperative assessments, and overall clinical outcomes.
