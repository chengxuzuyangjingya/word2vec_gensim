Acute and chronic effects of toxic metals on viability, encystment and bioluminescence in the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax polyedra.	Toxicity bioassays based on survival were carried out with cells of the marine dinoflagellate Gonyaulax polyedra exposed to mercury (Hg2+ ), cadmium (Cd2+), lead (Pb2+) and copper (Cu2+). The toxicity scale of these metals found was Hg2+ > Cu2+ > Cd2+ > Pb2+. Cells exposed to metals promptly underwent encystment, which is an important strategy for surviving metal exposure. Following 48 h exposure to Cu2+, complete excystment occurred within 96 h after reinoculation of cells in fresh metal-free media, and with Pb2+ partial recovery occurred in that time. Bioluminescence was affected by the metals in a dose-dependent manner primarily by increasing the frequency of flashing, but the glow emission was also altered with acute Cu2+ and Pb2+ treatments. Several physiological processes in G. polyedra are under circadian control. Chronic exposures to metals caused no substantial alterations in the circadian rhythm of bioluminescence glow, indicating that the biological clock of this dinoflagellate is not sensitive to these metals at the concentrations tested.
Prediction of fathead minnow acute toxicity of organic compounds from molecular structure.	Interest in the prediction of toxicity without the use of experimental data is growing, and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods are valuable for such predictions. A QSAR study of acute aqueous toxicity of 375 diverse organic compounds has been developed using only calculated structural features as independent variables. Toxicity is expressed as -log(LD(50)) with the units -log(millimoles per liter) and ranges from -3 to 6. Multiple linear regression and computational neural networks (CNNs) are utilized for model building. The best model is a nonlinear CNN model based on eight calculated molecular structure descriptors. The root-mean-square log(LD(50)) errors for the training, cross-validation, and prediction sets of this CNN model are 0.71, 0.77, and 0.74 -log(mmol/L), respectively. These results are compared to a previous study with the same data set which included many more descriptors and used experimental data in the descriptor pool.
The duration of non-rodent toxicity studies for pharmaceuticals. International Conference on Harmonication (ICH).	At the present time, there are no uniform standards for the duration of non-rodent chronic toxicity studies. The European Union (EU) requires a 6-month non-rodent study. In Japan, a 6-month study is sufficient for most, but not all, compounds. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains its standard duration of 12 months for non-rodents, with 6-month studies accepted for some clinical indications on a case-by-case basis. To achieve harmonization on the duration of non-rodent toxicity studies, each member regulatory region (EU, U.S., and Japan) of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) collected non-rodent studies with significant new toxicological findings that had occurred after 6 months. An ICH expert working group was organized that included representatives from the regulatory authorities of each ICH region, to jointly review all available case studies for the purpose of arriving at a consensus on the best duration time for non-rodent toxicity studies. Eighteen case studies were identified and evaluated (16 original cases plus 2 additional FDA cases); most of the toxicities identified fell into the following categories: (1) toxicities identified at 6 months; (2) toxicities observed at 12 months, which were absent or considered isolated and not noteworthy findings at 6 months; (3) drug-related deaths or morbidity that occurred between 6 and 12 months, with a pattern of toxicity that permitted the interpolation of findings to an intermediate interval between 6 and 12 months; and (4) a shift in the dose response for toxicity with increasing duration of drug exposure. Of the 18 cases evaluated, 11 supported a study-duration of 9-12 months, 4 supported a duration of 12 months, and the 3 remaining cases indicated that a 6-month study would be adequate. The working group concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support a harmonized 9-month duration for non-rodent toxicity studies, which would be applicable for most categories of pharmaceuticals.
Depression of glutathione content, elevation of CYP2E1-dependent activation, and the principal determinant of the fasting-mediated enhancement of 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol hepatotoxicity in the rat.	The influence of fasting (18 hours) on the hepatotoxicity of 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol (1,3-DCP) and on various hepatic parameters has been assessed in the rat. Fasting produced an enhancement of the hepatotoxicity which was associated with alterations in a variety of hepatic parameters when measured relative to protein content, most notably glutathione (GSH) levels (decrease) and CYP2E1-mediated enzyme activity (increase), two parameters previously identified as being important determinants to the toxicity. Fasting also decreased the liver weight normalized to body weight. When this was taken into account, total liver CYP2E1-mediated enzyme activity was not significantly altered whereas the total liver GSH level was markedly reduced following fasting. These results imply that the reduction in hepatic GSH is the principal determinant of the enhanced susceptibility to 1,3-DCP hepatotoxicity following fasting.
A tiered approach to threshold of regulation.	This paper presents methods for extending the principle of a single "threshold of regulation" to a range of dietary concentrations between 0.5 and 15 parts per billion by using structure-activity relationships, genotoxicity, and short-term toxicity data. The database used to develop the FDA's threshold of regulation was examined to determine whether structural parameters or the result of certain short-term toxicity tests could be used to define a subset of less potent substances that supports higher threshold levels. In addition, results of reproductive toxicity tests for 3306 compounds and other multidose toxicity tests for 2542 compounds were compared with the database of carcinogenic potencies to establish that carcinogenic endpoints are the most conservative toxicity endpoint for establishing thresholds of regulation.
Toxicity of oxidized fats II: tissue levels of lipid peroxides in rats fed a thermally oxidized corn oil diet.	Male Wistar albino rats were fed for 21 days on a diet in which fat (12%) was included either as fresh corn oil, malonaldehyde content = 0.11+/-0.05 micro microg/g (control) or thermally oxidized corn oil, malonaldehyde content = 0.20+/-0.03 microg/g (experimental) and the tissue levels of lipid peroxides in six organs-namely, liver, kidney, brain, heart, lungs and testes-were determined. Of the organs studied, significantly (P < 0.1) higher concentrations of lipid peroxides were observed only in the liver and kidney of the experimental rats. In the course of the feeding, the experimental rats showed significantly (P < 0.1) lower gains in body weights as well as higher relative liver weights than the control rats.
Coumarin metabolism, toxicity and carcinogenicity: relevance for human risk assessment.	The metabolism, toxicity and results of tests for carcinogenicity have been reviewed with respect to the safety for humans of coumarin present in foodstuffs and from fragrance use in cosmetic products. Coumarin is a natural product which exhibits marked species differences in both metabolism and toxicity. The majority of tests for mutagenic and genotoxic potential suggest that coumarin is not a genotoxic agent. The target organs for toxicity and carcinogenicity in the rat and mouse are primarily the liver and lung. Moreover, the dose-response relationships for coumarin-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity are non-linear, with tumour formation only being observed at high doses which are associated with hepatic and pulmonary toxicity. Other species, including the Syrian hamster, are seemingly resistant to coumarin-induced toxicity. There are marked differences in coumarin metabolism between susceptible rodent species and other species including humans. It appears that the 7-hydroxylation pathway of coumarin metabolism, the major pathway in most human subjects but only a minor pathway in the rat and mouse, is a detoxification pathway. In contrast, the major route of coumarin metabolism in the rat and mouse is by a 3,4-epoxidation pathway resulting in the formation of toxic metabolites. The maximum daily human exposure to coumarin from dietary sources for a 60-kg consumer has been estimated to be 0.02 mg/kg/day. From fragrance use in cosmetic products, coumarin exposure has been estimated to be 0.04 mg/kg/day. The total daily human exposure from dietary sources together with fragrance use in cosmetic products is thus 0.06 mg/kg/day. No adverse effects of coumarin have been reported in susceptible species in response to doses which are more than 100 times the maximum human daily intake. The mechanism of coumarin-induced tumour formation in rodents is associated with metabolism-mediated, toxicity and it is concluded that exposure to coumarin from food and/or cosmetic products poses no health risk to humans.
A toxicological assessment of curdlan.	Curdlan was approved for use by the FDA in December 1996 as a formulation aid, processing aid, stabilizer and thickener or texturizer for use in food. It has been evaluated for safety by a series of animal studies and in vitro tests including acute, subchronic and chronic toxicity studies and reproduction and carcinogenicity studies. In addition, nutritional studies in rodents and tolerance and metabolic studies in man have been carried out. The only effects seen in these studies were reductions in weight gain at the higher dietary concentrations due to the replacement of part of the diet by curdlan, which is calorifically inert. No evidence of any toxicity or carcinogenicity nor of any effects on reproduction was seen, although there was an effect on body weights of the pups with the 15% diet, which was shown in additional studies to be due to the reduced food availability in the animals at this dose level. There was no evidence of effects on the nutritional status of the animals nor on the absorption of minerals. This reviews the available toxicological data on curdlan.
A multi-laboratory evaluation of cryopreserved monkey hepatocyte functions for use in pharmaco-toxicology.	Ethical, economic and technical reasons hinder regular supply of freshly isolated hepatocytes from higher mammals such as monkey for preclinical evaluation of drugs. Hence, we aimed at developing optimal and reproducible protocols to cryopreserve and thaw parenchymal liver cells from this major toxicological species. Before the routine use of these protocols, we validated them through a multi-laboratory study. Dissociation of the whole animal liver resulted in obtaining 1-5 billion parenchymal cells with a viability of about 86%. An appropriate fraction (around 20%) of the freshly isolated cells was immediately set in primary culture and various hepato-specific tests were performed to examine their metabolic, biochemical and toxicological functions as well as their ultrastructural characteristics. The major part of the hepatocytes was frozen and their functionality checked using the same parameters after thawing. The characterization of fresh and thawed monkey hepatocytes demonstrated the maintenance of various hepato-specific functions. Indeed, cryopreserved hepatocytes were able to survive and to function in culture as well as their fresh counterparts. The ability for synthesis (proteins, ATP, GSH) and conjugation and secretion of biliary acids was preserved after deep freeze storage. A better stability of drug metabolizing activities than in rodent hepatocytes was observed in monkey. After thawing, Phase I and Phase II activities (cytochrome P450, ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase, aldrin epoxidase, epoxide hydrolase, glutathione transferase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase) were well preserved. The metabolic patterns of several drugs were qualitatively and quantitatively similar before and after cryopreservation. Lastly, cytotoxicity tests suggested that the freezing/thawing steps did not change cell sensitivity to toxic compounds.
Biologically active anthracenones from roots of Karwinskia parvifolia.	Tullidinol, a neurotoxin isolated from fruits and roots of several Karwinskia species, was resolved for the first time into two stereoisomers. This was achieved by means of preparative HPLC from roots of Karwinskia parvifolia. Structural assignments were made on the basis of spectroscopic data, including long range correlations as well as geometry optimization by means of semi-empirical methods.
Sequoiatones C-f, constituents of the redwood endophyte Aspergillus parasiticus.	Aspergillus parasiticus, a fungal isolate from a coast redwood tree (Sequoia sempervirens), has been shown to produce four new compounds, sequoiatones C-F (1-4). The structures of these compounds, all of which are cytotoxic to brine shrimp, were deduced by spectral analysis.
Makaluvamine P, a new cytotoxic pyrroloiminoquinone from Zyzzya cf. fuliginosa.	A new pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloid (1) belonging to the makaluvamine family has been isolated from the sponge Zyzzya cf. fuliginosa collected in the waters off the Vanuatu Islands. The compound, designated makulavamine P, was characterized on the basis of its spectral data and displayed cytoxicity in the microM range on KB cells and antioxidant activity.
(+)-epi-Alpha-bisabolol [correction of bisbolol] is the wound-healing principle of Peperomia galioides: investigation of the in vivo wound-healing activity of related terpenoids.	Bioassay-guided investigation of the ethanol extract of Peperomia galioides using a tensile strength method in mice as a monitor led to the isolation of epi-alpha-bisabolol (1) (ED(50) 155 microg/mL). An in vivo healing study of selected commercially available monoterpenoids yielded two bioactive compounds, alpha-bisabolol (2) and alpha-terpineol (3) (ED(50) of 228 and 240 microg/g mouse[corrected], respectively).
Measures for protecting water quality: current approaches and future developments.	An important component in protecting the ecological quality of watercourses is the regulation of point source discharges. These are usually expressed in terms of "end of pipe" limits on certain physical parameters or on the concentrations of specific chemicals. Sometimes discharge licences take the form of Emission Limit Values (ELVs) which are based on Best Available Technology with respect to emissions and apply to all discharges (usually for a specified industry sector) irrespective of the dilution capacity of the receiving watercourse. Alternatively, they may be based on water quality standards (e.g., EQSs) for specific chemicals which describe thresholds below which no adverse impact on the receiving water is predicted and which take explicit account of available dilution at different discharge locations. The strengths and limitations of these approaches are reviewed, along with a consideration of new approaches that address some of the limitations associated with control measures based on ELVs or EQSs. These include approaches for controlling well-defined mixtures by a "Toxic Equivalent" approach, exemplified here for discharges containing alkylphenol ethoxylate surfactants, and a fundamentally different approach for regulating complex effluents based on Direct Toxicity Assessment of whole effluents. Circumstances under which these different approaches to controlling point source emissions to surface waters might be appropriate are discussed.
Oestrogens have no hormonal effect on the development and reproduction of the harpacticoid copepod Nitocra spinipes.	In recent years, reports have described endocrine-disruptive effects of environmental oestrogens in fish, but little is known about similar effects in crustaceans. The objective of the present study was therefore to examine whether the oestrogens 17-beta-oestradiol, 17-alpha-ethynylestradiol and diethylstilbestrol (DES), could affect mortality, larval development rate, fecundity and sex ratio in the sexually reproducing harpacticoid copepod Nitocra spinipes. Newly released nauplii (<24-h old) were exposed to 1/1,000, 1/100 and 1/10 (nominal concentrations) of each oestrogen's 96 h-LC50 value for < or = 18 days at 22 +/- 1 degrees C. The percentage of gravid females and the number of developed copepodites were both reduced at 0.03 mg l(-1) DES, although the latter response was not significant. None of the other two oestrogens induced any measurable effects. Since the only observed significant response appeared at a DES concentration no more than 10 times below the 96 h-LC50 value, there is no evidence of endocrine-disruptive activity in N. spinipes exposed to oestrogens.
Insecticidal arylalkylbenzhydrolpiperidines: novel inhibitors of voltage-sensitive sodium and calcium channels in mammalian brain.	Using preparations derived from whole mouse brain, we have demonstrated that insecticidal arylalkylbenzhydrolpiperidines inhibit the depolarization of synaptoneurosomes as measured by rhodamine 6G fluorescence and block 22Na+ uptake into synaptosomes, when veratridine is used as the activator. These insecticides also have the ability to potently displace the binding of [3H]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate ([3H]BTX-B) to neuronal sodium channels in a concentration-dependent manner. The study compounds can be classified as competitive inhibitors of radioligand binding, since they decrease the affinity of [3H]BTX-B for site 2 without affecting the concentration of sites labelled by this radioligand. Our kinetic analyses revealed that at its IC50, the 4-carbomethoxyaminobenzyl-piperidine analogue reduces the rate of association of [3H]BTX-B with site 2, whereas higher concentrations were required to accelerate dissociation of the [3H]BTX-B:sodium channel complex. These results indicate an ability to interact with both non-activated and persistently activated states of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel, but higher affinity for the former. Such a profile also implies that inhibition of [3H]BTX-B binding to site 2 occurs via an allosteric mechanism. In addition, arylalkylbenzhydrolpiperidines interact with presynaptic voltage-sensitive calcium channels, since we demonstrate that they inhibit increases in [free Ca++] and 45Ca++ uptake when evoked by high KC1 concentration in mouse brain synaptosomal preparations. Such effects generally occur at concentrations that are higher than those required to inhibit sodium channels. Blockade of sodium and calcium channels may therefore contribute to the in vivo neurological effects observed in rodents exposed to these insecticides.
Semiconductor-mediated photocatalysed degradation of two selected pesticide derivatives, terbacil and 2,4,5-tribromoimidazole, in aqueous suspension.	The photocatalysed degradation of two selected pesticide derivatives, namely 3-tert-butyl-5-chloro-6-methyluracil (terbacil) and 2,4,5-tribromoimidazole (TBI) has been investigated in aqueous suspensions of titanium dioxide (TiO2) under a variety of conditions employing a pH-stat technique. The degradation was studied by monitoring the change in substrate concentration of the model compound employing HPLC analysis, and the decrease in total organic carbon (TOC) content, respectively, as a function of irradiation time. The degradation kinetics were studied under different conditions such as reaction pH, substrate and photocatalyst concentration, type of TiO2 photocatalyst and the presence of alternative additives such as H2O2, KBrO3 and (NH4)2S2O8 besides molecular oxygen. The degradation rates and the photonic efficiencies were found to be strongly influenced by the above parameters. Toxicity tests for the irradiated samples of the pesticide derivatives measuring the luminescence of bacteria Vibrio fischeri after 30 minutes of incubation were also performed.
Occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sewage sludge and their contribution to its toxicity in the toxalert 100 bioassay.	The contribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) present in sewage sludge samples to toxicity was investigated. Chemical analysis using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the ToxAlert 100 bioassay, based on the inhibition to Vibrio fischeri, were applied to sludge extracts after purification by column chromatography. The levels of the 16 US EPA PAH analyzed in the sewage sludge samples varied from 17 to 2,030 microg kg(-1). In all samples examined phenanthrene was the most prominent compound. The toxicity data obtained by ToxAlert 100 can be explained by the levels and composition of the different PAH in sewage sludge samples. The present approach can contribute to evaluate the toxicity of sewage sludge.
Thresholds in contact sensitization: immunologic mechanisms and experimental evidence in humans--an overview.	The evidence from practical experience in man, from controlled human testing and from both chemical and biological mechanistic considerations, demonstrates that the thresholds for skin sensitization exist both at the level of induction as well as sensitization. For a given contact allergen, the concentration (expressed in dose per unit area), which is at the threshold, has to be defined in terms of the nature and extent of the skin contact involved, and whether it is the induction of skin sensitization or its elicitation that is involved, since the numerical values will depend heavily on these parameters. The induction and elicitation of contact allergy is influenced by several factors: the total dose of the allergen, its surface concentration, the size of area over which it is applied, antigenic potency of the substance, number of exposures, anatomical site of exposure, effect of draining lymph nodes, matrix (vehicle) of allergen, effect of occlusion, degree of percutaneous penetration, effect of diseased skin/trauma and possibly a host of other, as yet unknown, variables.
Acute and subacute toxicity and efficacy of S-nitrosylated captopril, an ACE inhibitor possessing nitric oxide activities.	The toxicity and efficacy of S-nitrosocaptopril (CapNO), a novel vasodilator possessing the capacities of both a nitric oxide donor and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were examined in rodents. In single-dose acute toxicity studies in ICR mice, the median lethal dose (LD(50)) for CapNO was 674+/-94 mg/kg (iv) and 2078+/-100 mg/kg (po), whereas for oral captopril was 4286+/-173 mg/kg. S-nitrosoglutathione, containing the same S-nitroso moiety as CapNO, showed an LD(50) equal to CapNO when the values were expressed by the mol/kg. The cause of acute death by the high doses of CapNO was lethal hypotension. In the subacute toxicity studies, oral CapNO was well tolerated in normotensive and hypertensive rats at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day for 3 months, except for considerable reductions in food consumption and growth rate observed in the 500 mg/kg/day group. Serum chemistry and hematology tests performed in the subacute toxicity studies revealed no adverse effects of oral CapNO except for a significant decrease in cholesterol levels in hypertensive SHR rat. At autopsy, no histopathological changes in major organs were observed over the subacute period. Administration of a therapeutic dose of CapNO (iv, 250 microg/kg which produced 25% decreases in blood pressure) revealed no changes in the hematological parameters. Subchronic treatment of SHR and SS/Jr rats with oral CapNO (50 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced mean arterial pressure to the normotensive level. Considering the absence of adverse effects of CapNO in the subchronic toxicity study, CapNO appears to be a safe drug for further clinical trials, but particular caution must be taken because it can cause hypotension when overdosed.
Search of a topological pattern to evaluate toxicity of heterogeneous compounds.	Molecular connectivity has been applied to the search of mathematical models able to predict the carcinogenic and teratogenic activity of a wide group of structurally heterogeneous compounds. Through the linear discriminant analysis and the diagrams of distribution of pharmacological activity, the classification criteria that minimizes the percentage of error are established. The easiness and speed of the calculation of the descriptors used in this work make the models developed useful in data bases containing a huge number of compounds.
Embryonic stem cells as an in vitro model for mutagenicity, cytotoxicity and embryotoxicity studies: present state and future prospects.	Primary cultures or established cell lines of vertebrates are commonly used to analyse the mutagenic, embryotoxic or teratogenic potential of environmental factors, drugs and xenobiotics in vitro. However, these cellular systems do not include developmental processes from early embryonic stages up to terminally differentiated cell types. An alternative approach has been offered by permanent lines of pluripotent stem cells of embryonic origin, such as embryonic carcinoma (EC), embryonic stem (ES) and embryonic germ (EG) cells. The undifferentiated stem cell lines are characterized by nearly unlimited self-renewal capacity and have been shown to differentiate in vitro into cells of all three primary germ layers. Pluripotent embryonic stem cell lines recapitulate cellular developmental processes and gene expression patterns of early embryogenesis during in vitro differentiation, data which are summarized in this review. In addition, recent studies are presented which investigated mutagenic, cytotoxic and embryotoxic effects of chemical substances using in vitro systems of pluripotent embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, an outlook is given on future molecular technologies using embryonic stem cells in developmental toxicology and embryotoxicology.
Sequential (anaerobic/aerobic) biological treatment of Dalaman SEKA pulp and paper industry effluent.	In the pulp and paper industry, lignin and other color compounds are removed by chemical agents in bleaching process. Use of chlorine-based agents results in production of degradation products which include various chloro-organic derivatives. Since these new compounds are highly chlorinated, they cause a problem in the treatment of pulp and paper industry wastewaters. Chemical precipitation, lagooning, activated sludge, and anaerobic treatment are the processes used for treating pulp and paper effluents. Furthermore, a combination of these processes is also applicable. In this study, the effluent of Dalaman SEKA Pulp and Paper Industry was examined for its toxic effects on anaerobic microorganisms by anaerobic toxicity assay. Additionally, this wastewater was applied to a sequential biotreatment process consisting of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket as the anaerobic stage and a once-through completely mixed stirred tank as the aerobic stage. Results indicated that: (1) Dalaman SEKA Pulp and Paper Industry wastewater exerted no inhibitory effects on the anaerobic cultures under the studied conditions, and (2) application of a sequential biological (anaerobic/aerobic) system to treat the Dalaman SEKA Pulp and Paper Industry wastewater resulted in approximately 91% COD and 58% AOX removals at a HRT of 5 and 6.54 h for anaerobic and aerobic, respectively.
Effect of sediment toxicity on anaerobic microbial metabolism.	Mineralization of a readily biodegradable aromatic compound (benzoate) by intrinsic microorganisms in the anoxic sediment was used to quantify the inhibitory effect of heavily contaminated sediment from the Arthur Kill estuary (NY/NJ Harbor system, USA) on the anaerobic metabolism by naturally present bacterial populations. In anoxic microcosms, the effect of varying ratios of contaminated sediment:site water and contaminated sediment:noncontaminated sediment (Flax Pond, Stony Brook, NY, USA) were investigated. In all cases, increasing the ratio of Arthur Kill sediment in the microcosms showed an inhibitory effect on the rate of 14C-benzoate mineralization as measured by the evolution of 14CO2. This inhibitory effect could be alleviated through dilution of the sediment with noncontaminated sediment, resulting in some cases in mineralization rates that were greater by an order of magnitude. The toxicity of the sediment was confirmed by whole-sediment Microtox bioassay. Analysis of the sediment revealed high (>200 mg/kg) levels of Pb, Cu, Zn, and Cr, suggesting that heavy metals may contribute to overall sediment toxicity.
A novel toxicity fingerprinting method for pollutant identification with lux-marked biosensors.	A novel technique is described for the identification and quantification of environmental pollutants based on toxicity fingerprinting with a metabolic lux-marked bacterial biosensor. This method involved characterizing the toxicity-based responses of the biosensor to seven calibration pollutants as acute temporal-dose response fingerprints. An algorithm is described to allow comparisons of responses of an unknown pollutant to be made against the calibration data. This is based on predicting pollutant concentration at each of six different time points over the course of a 5-min assay. If the prediction is consistent between the unknown pollutant and a calibration pollutant at the 95% test level, this is considered to be a positive identification. All seven calibration pollutants could be successfully distinguished from each other with this technique. Environmental samples, individually spiked with single concentrations of pollutants, were compared in this way against the calibration pollutants. An 83% identification success was achieved, with no false positives at the 95% test level. This is a simple and rapid technique that potentially can be applied to monitoring of industrial wastewater or as a screening tool for regulators.
Induction of morphological deformities in Chironomus tentans exposed to zinc- and lead-spiked sediments.	Laboratory experiments were used to assess morphological responses of Chironomus tentans larvae exposed to three levels of zinc and lead. Chironomus tentans egg masses were placed into triplicate control and metal-spiked aquaria containing the measured concentrations 1,442, 3,383, and 5,562 microg/g Pb dry weight and 1,723, 3,743, and 5,252 microg/g Zn dry weight. Larvae were collected at 10-d intervals after egg masses were placed in aquaria until final emergence. Larvae were screened for mouthpart deformities and metal body burdens. Deformities increased with time of exposure in both Zn and Pb tanks. Deformity rates between the three Zn concentrations differed statistically, with low and medium Zn levels containing the highest overall deformity rates of 12%. Deformity rates for larvae held in the Pb aquaria were found to differ significantly. Larvae in the low-Pb tanks had a deformity rate of 9%. Larvae and water from both the Zn and Pb aquaria had increasing metal concentrations with increasing sediment metal concentration. Results demonstrate that Zn and Pb each induce chironomid mouthpart deformities at various concentrations. However, a clear dose-related response was not demonstrated. Our research provides more support for the potential use of chironomid deformities as a tool for the assessment of heavy metal pollution in aquatic systems.
Toxicity identification of metals: development of toxicity identification fingerprints.	The ecotoxicological and chemical response of five metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn) to selective fractionation techniques was assessed using the organism Daphnia magna. The metals Cu and Zn revealed similar toxicity patterns, showing an increased toxicity when lowering the pH, a marked reduction in toxicity after addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Similar toxicity reductions were obtained by passing the metal solutions over ion exchangers, activated charcoal, and filtration/solid-phase extraction units at neutral and basic pHs. The discrimination between Cu- and Zn-toxicity occurred in the oxidant reduction test, i.e., Zn toxicity was not affected by the addition of Na2S2O3, while Cu toxicity was strongly reduced. A second cluster was formed by Cd and Ni. The toxicity of both metals markedly decreased in the EDTA, ion exchangers, activated charcoal, filtration, and solid-phase extraction tests at high pHs. Discrimination between the toxicity of both metals was accomplished with the graduated pH test, in which a pH-independent toxicity response was found for Ni while the toxicity of Cd increased at lower pHs. Compared with the other metals, a very distinct toxicity pattern for Cr was observed. From the applied fractionation techniques, only the graduated pH and the anion resin tests resulted in a marked change in Cr toxicity. The produced toxicity patterns for each individual metal could therefore be used as fingerprints (i.e., toxicity identification fingerprints) in order to identify the toxicity caused by individual metals for D. magna.
Chemical characterization of lipid A from some marine proteobacteria.	Lipids A from type and wild strains of marine Proteobacteria belonging to Alteromonadaceae (Alteromonas (1 species), Idiomarina (1 species), and Pseudoalteromonas (8 species) genera) and Vibrionaceae (Shewanella (1 species) and Vibrio (1 species) genera) families and Marinomonas genus (1 species) were isolated by hydrolysis of their respective lipopolysaccharides with 1% acetic acid. Based on thin-layer chromatography data, the lipids A studied had low heterogeneity and generated family-specific patterns varying in numbers of bands and their chromatographic mobility. Total chemical analysis of the compounds showed that they contained glucosamine, phosphate, and fatty acids with decanoate (I. zobellii KMM 231(T) lipid A) or dodecanoate (lipids A of the other bacteria) and 3-hydroxy alkanoates as the major fatty acid components. Unlike terrestrial bacterial lipids A, lipids A of marine Proteobacteria had basically monophosphoryl (except V. fluvialis AQ 0002B lipid A with its two phosphate groups) and pentaacyl (except S. alga 48055 and V. fluvialis AQ 0002B lipids A which were found to have six residues of fatty acids per molecule of glucosamine disaccharide) structural types, low toxicity, and may be useful as potential endotoxin antagonists.
Parametrization of electrophilicity for the prediction of the toxicity of aromatic compounds.	The aim of this study was to determine which descriptor best parametrized the electrophilicity of aromatic compounds with regard to their acute toxicity. To achieve this, toxicity data for 203 substituted aromatic compounds containing a nitro- or cyano group were evaluated in the 40-h Tetrahymena pyriformis population growth impairment assay. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) were developed relating toxic potency [log(IGC(50)(-1))] with hydrophobicity quantified by the 1-octanol/water partition coefficient (log P) and electrophilic reactivity quantified by the molecular orbital parameters, either the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (E(LUMO)) or maximum acceptor superdelocalizability (A(max)) was developed. For the full data set, E(LUMO) and A(max) were collinear (r = 0.87). A comparison of the QSARs [log(IGC(50)(-1)) = 0.40 log P - 0.94E(LUMO) - 1.27; n = 203, r(2) = 0.60, s = 0.49, F = 151] and [log(IGC(50)(-1)) = 0.37 log P + 13.1A(max) - 4.30; n = 203, r(2) = 0.70, s = 0.42, F = 237] reveals A(max) to be the better electrophilic parameter for modeling these data. Analysis of outliers indicates a preponderance of 4-subsituted nitrophenols and nitroanilines. Smaller datasets (51 and 102 compounds) selected in order to reduce the collinearity between A(max) and E(LUMO) were also evaluated. Results indicate A(max) to be the superior descriptor of electrophilicity for the purpose of toxicological QSARs for aromatic compounds. Development of QSARs using partial least-squares yielded similar results.
Linear regression and computational neural network prediction of tetrahymena acute toxicity for aromatic compounds from molecular structure.	A quantitative structure toxicity relationship (QSTR) has been derived for a diverse set of 448 industrially important aromatic solvents. Toxicity was expressed as the 50% growth impairment concentration (ICG(50)) for the ciliated protozoa Tetrahymena and spans the range -1.46 to 3.36 log units. Molecular descriptors that encode topological, geometrical, electronic, and hybrid geometrical-electronic structural features were calculated for each compound. Subsets of molecular descriptors were selected via a simulated annealing technique and a genetic algorithm. From this reduced pool of descriptors, multiple linear regression models and nonlinear models using computational neural networks (CNNs) were derived and then used to predict the ICG(50) values for an external set of representative compounds. An average of 10 nonlinear CNN models with 11-5-1 architecture was found to best describe the system with root-mean-square errors of 0.28, 0.29, and 0.34 log units for the training, cross validation, and prediction sets, respectively.
Chemical analysis of World Trade Center fine particulate matter for use in toxicologic assessment.	The catastrophic destruction of the World Trade Center (WTC) on 11 September 2001 caused the release of high levels of airborne pollutants into the local environment. To assess the toxicity of fine particulate matter [particulate matter with a mass median aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 microm (PM2.5)], which may adversely affect the health of workers and residents in the area, we collected fallen dust samples on 12 and 13 September 2001 from sites within a half-mile of Ground Zero. Samples of WTC dust were sieved, aerosolized, and size-separated, and the PM2.5 fraction was isolated on filters. Here we report the chemical and physical properties of PM2.5 derived from these samples and compare them with PM2.5 fractions of three reference materials that range in toxicity from relatively inert to acutely toxic (Mt. St. Helens PM; Washington, DC, ambient air PM; and residual oil fly ash). X-ray diffraction of very coarse sieved WTC PM (< 53 microm) identified calcium sulfate (gypsum) and calcium carbonate (calcite) as major components. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that calcium-sulfur and calcium-carbon particles were also present in the WTC PM2.5 fraction. Analysis of WTC PM2.5 using X-ray fluorescence, neutron activation analysis, and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry showed high levels of calcium (range, 22-33%) and sulfur (37-43% as sulfate) and much lower levels of transition metals and other elements. Aqueous extracts of WTC PM2.5 were basic (pH range, 8.9-10.0) and had no evidence of significant bacterial contamination. Levels of carbon were relatively low, suggesting that combustion-derived particles did not form a significant fraction of these samples recovered in the immediate aftermath of the destruction of the towers. Because gypsum and calcite are known to cause irritation of the mucus membranes of the eyes and respiratory tract, inhalation of high doses of WTC PM2.5 could potentially cause toxic respiratory effects.
Assessment of occupational health hazards in scrap-tire shredding facilities.	Occupational hygiene conditions in scrap-tire shredding facilities were assessed to identify potential health risk factors for workers and provide a basis for developing future control measures. Specifically, noise, volatile organics and particulate levels were measured at two plants. Particulate/dust levels were measured via filter collection, and were analyzed gravimetrically. Sound pressure levels were measured and their spectral properties analyzed. Moreover, the major chemical species in the samples were identified using GC/MS. Finally, the mutagenic activity associated with the airborne particulates was assessed using a typical Ames test applied to Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100, with or without bio-activation. The noise levels were steady and high throughout the facilities, ranging from 85 to approximately 100 dBA. The octave band spectrum analysis reveals pattern similarity among the different areas. Levels of volatile organics were not significant, but a few mutagens/carcinogens, such as styrene, benzothiazole, phthalate ester and naphthalene were identified. Total particulate levels ranged from 0.43 to 6.54 mg/m(3), while respirable particulates were in the range 0.23-1.25 mg/m(3). Ames testing revealed indirect mutagenicity on strain TA98, indicating possible effects of frame-shift type mutagens. Chemical analysis of airborne particulates confirmed the presence of amines, aniline, quinoline, amides and benzothiazole, which are potentially convertible to frame-shift type mutagenic nitrosoamines. Noise appears to be an occupational hazard for workers at scrap-tire shredding facilities, but the risk associated with the mutagenic/carcinogenic property of particulates requires further confirmation.
Is the interaction between felbamate and valproate against seizures induced by 4-aminopyridine and pentylenetetrazole in mice beneficial?	We compared the effects of adding a non-protective dose of valproate (VPA) to increasing single doses of felbamate (FBM) with those of monotherapy and vice versa in CD1 mice. Anticonvulsant effects were evaluated against seizures induced by 14 mg kg(-1) of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and by 110 mg kg(-1) of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), and neurotoxicity by the rotarod test. The study also assessed changes in concentrations of anticonvulsants, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate in the whole brain. VPA increased the potency ratio of FBM against 4-AP (1.94, P<0.05) but not against PTZ. VPA increased the neurotoxicity of FBM (3.30, P<0.05) and the protective index of FBM was, therefore, reduced from 12.0 to 7.0 for the 4-AP model and from 11.8 to 5.2 for the PTZ model; VPA reduced brain FBM, and increased brain GABA in relation to FBM monotherapy. On the other hand, FBM increased the potency ratio of VPA against 4-AP (1.60, P<0.05) but not against the PTZ, and had no effect on the rotarod model. Therefore, the protective index increased from 1.1 to 1.6 for the 4-AP model and decreased from 1.9 to 1.7 for the PTZ model. FBM did not change brain VPA, and changes in brain GABA and glutamate were not clearly related to anticonvulsant effects. In conclusion, although the addition of a low dose of FBM to VPA was beneficial in the 4-AP model, the addition of a low dose of VPA to FBM was not; both combinations were disadvantageous in the PTZ model. This interaction appears to be pharmacodynamic because a pharmacokinetic mechanism was discarded.
Dopamine-dependent cytotoxicity of tetrahydrobiopterin: a possible mechanism for selective neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. While the underlying cause of this cell death is poorly understood, oxidative stress is thought to play a role. We have previously shown that tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an obligatory co-factor for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), exerts selective toxicity on dopamine-producing cells and that this is prevented by antioxidants. This study shows that BH4-induced dopaminergic cell death is primarily mediated by dopamine, evidenced by findings that (i) BH4 toxicity is increased in proportion to cellular dopamine content; (ii) non-dopaminergic cells become susceptible to BH4 upon exposure to dopamine; and (iii) depletion of dopamine attenuates BH4 toxicity in dopamine-producing cells. BH4 causes lipid peroxidation, suggesting involvement of oxidative stress but the toxicity does not require enzymatic oxidation of dopamine. Instead, it seems to involve formation of quinone product(s) because (i) the cell death is attenuated by exposure to or induction of quinone reductase and (ii) BH4-treated cells show increased formation of protein-bound quinones, which is inhibited by thiol antioxidants. These data taken together suggest that the presence of both BH4 and dopamine is important in rendering dopaminergic cells vulnerable and that this involves formation of reactive dopamine quinone products.
Preparation of "high specific activity" radiochemical forms of vanadium, manganese and thallium for metallo-toxicological studies.	In this paper are presented the production methods for very "high specific activity" radionuclides (HSA-RN) of vanadium, manganese and thallium which have been developed in our laboratories for labelling different chemical forms of these elements present in the echo-systems in ultra-trace amounts, for metallo-toxicological and bio-kinetic studies. Use was made of both cyclotron and thermal nuclear reactor. If the nuclear reaction product has atomic number different from irradiated target, it is possible separating the radioactive nuclide from irradiated target, without addition of isotopic carrier. This kind of radionuclide is named No Carrier Added, NCA, and his specific activity, As is very high and can reach values close to the theoretical Carrier Free one, CF. The experimental determination of specific activity, chemical and radiochemical purities is mandatory for all these kinds of applications.
Aquatic toxicity of glyphosate-based formulations: comparison between different organisms and the effects of environmental factors.	Glyphosate-based herbicides (e.g. Roundup) are extensively used in the aquatic environment, but there is a paucity of data on the toxicity of the formulated products and the influences by environmental factors. In this study, the acute toxicity of technical-grade glyphosate acid, isopropylamine (IPA) salt of glyphosate, Roundup and its surfactant polyoxyethylene amine (POEA) to Microtox bacterium (Vibrio fischeri), microalgae (Selenastrum capricornutum and Skeletonema costatum), protozoa (Tetrahymena pyriformis and Euplotes vannus) and crustaceans (Ceriodaphnia dubia and Acartia tonsa) was examined and the relative toxicity contributions of POEA to Roundup were calculated. The effects of four environmental factors (temperature, pH, suspended sediment and algal food concentrations) on the acute toxicity of Roundup to C. dubia were also examined. Generally, the toxicity order of the chemicals was: POEA>Roundup>glyphosate acid>IPA salt of glyphosate, while the toxicity of glyphosate acid was mainly due to its high acidity. Microtox bacterium and protozoa had similar sensitivities towards Roundup toxicity (i.e. IC50 from 23.5 to 29.5 mg AE/l). In contrast, microalgae and crustaceans were 4-5 folds more sensitive to Roundup toxicity than bacteria and protozoa. Except photosynthetic microalgae, POEA accounted for more than 86% of Roundup toxicity and the toxicity contribution of POEA was shown to be species-dependent. Increase in pH (6-9) and increase of suspended sediment concentration (0-200 mg/l) significantly increased the toxicity of Roundup to C. dubia, but there were no significant effects due to temperature change and food addition.
Ozonation of an azo dye C.I. Remazol Black 5 and toxicological assessment of its oxidation products.	The effect of ozonation (20.5 mgl(-1)) on the degradation processes of an azo dye, Remazol Black 5 (RB5; CI) was studied. Conventional parameters such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), pH, conductivity, colour removal, biodegradability (BOD(5/28)), and toxic potential of the dye and its degradation products were monitored during the process. The results obtained indicated that ozonation is a highly effective way to remove the colour of a corresponding dye solution. However, a considerable organic load still remained as indicated by high COD and TOC residues. The COD, TOC reductions were about 40% and 25% for 6 h ozonation of 2 gl(-1) RB5 aqueous solution. During the ozonation process the rapid decrease of pH and the sharp increase of conductivity indicated the formation of acidic by-products and small fragments and ions which were identified by high performance ion chromatography. The BOD28 data revealed that first by-products after partial ozonation (10-150 min) of RB5 were more biodegradable than the parent compound and ozonation can enhance the biodegradability of azo dyes. During the first 150 min of total 360 min of oxidation, the formation of first by-products with high toxic potential took place as it could be confirmed by two acute toxicity-screening tests, the bioluminescence test (Vibrio fischerii) and the neutral red cytotoxicity assay (rat hepatoma cells). The significant enhancement of microbial biodegradability after long-term ozonation could also be seen as a decrease of toxic intermediates in correlation with the ozonation time as indicated in BOD28 biological degradation test results.
Mineral toxicity and physiological functions in tree seedlings irrigated with effluents of varying chemistry in sandy soil of dry region.	Effluents namely canal water as control (T1); municipal effluent (T2); textile effluent (T3); steel effluent (T4); textile + municipal effluent in 1:1 ratio (T5); steel + municipal effluent in 1:2 ratio (T6); steel + municipal + textile in 1:2:2 ratio (T7); and steel + textile in 1:2 ratio (T8) were added to the seedlings of Acacia nilotica and Eucalyptus camaldulensis. The aim was to monitor the toxic effect of the accumulated mineral ions on the physiological functions and ultimately to utilize these effluents in tree plantation. Foliage mineral concentration, leaf water potential (LWP), rate of photosynthesis (Pn), rate of transpiration (T) and stomatal conductance (g) were recorded. Mineral accumulation increased in the seedlings of T2 treatment. However, the accumulation of Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn was the highest (p<0.001) in the seedlings of T4, T6, T7, and T8 treatments affecting N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na concentration. The seedlings of T3 treatment had less Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn and medium N, Ca, and P concentration, which were negatively correlated with Na concentration in foliage and the amount added through effluent irrigation. Concentration of N, K, Ca, Mg, and Na was higher in the foliage of A. nilotica whereas P, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn were high in E. camaldulensis. Early two months data showed reduction (p<0.01) in Pn (87%), T (81%), g (67%), and LWP as a result of metal stresses (toxicity) in T6, T7, and T8 seedlings. E. camaldulensis maintained high LWP and Pn and low T and g compared to A. nilotica. High LWP in the seedlings of T2 was associated (p<0.05) high Pn, T, and g. However, these physiological parameters lowered in the seedlings of T3 and T5. Seedlings of T1, T2, and T5 maintained high LWP, Pn, T, and g throughout the experimental period. These parameters however, decreased (p<0.01) in the seedlings of T3 treatment subsequently through Na induced deficiency of Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn. The enhanced physiological functions in T5 treatment were probably the result of ameliorative effect of municipal effluent through increased mineral status. The study suggests that excess accumulation of Na, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn leads to metal toxicity that adversely affects physiology of the tree seedlings. Mixing of effluents and/or removal of excess would ameliorate these toxic effects and could be the better management practices for their use in tree irrigation.
Fish full life-cycle testing for the weak estrogen 4-tert-pentylphenol on medaka (Oryzias latipes).	We studied the chronic effects of 4-tert-pentylphenol (4-PP) on reproductive status of medaka (Oryzias latipes) over two generations under continuous exposure, with the goal of verifying the applicability of the fish full life-cycle test (FFLC) for this weak estrogen with this species. The exposure of parental (F0) medaka to 4-PP was begun on embryos within 12 h after fertilization and continued for up to 101 d, with monitoring of embryological development, hatching, posthatch survival, growth, sexual differentiation, reproduction, and hepatic vitellogenin (VTG) levels under flow-through exposure to 4-PP at mean measured concentrations of 51.1, 100, 224, 402, and 931 microg/L. Eggs (F1) spawned from the F0 fish at 99, 100, and 101 d after hatch also were examined for hatchability, survival after hatching, growth, sexual differentiation, and hepatic VTG levels, until 61 d after hatch. In the FFLC with the F0 medaka, the lowest-observed-effect concentration (LOEC) of 4-PP for lethal and sublethal toxicity (as shown by growth inhibition) was 931 microg/L. The LOECs for estrogenic effects (as shown by abnormal sexual differentiation and VTG induction) were 224 and < or = 51.1 microg/L, respectively, and the LOEC for reproductive impairment was 224 microg/L. Therefore, the effective concentrations of 4-PP for abnormal sexual differentiation and reproductive impairment were about four times lower than those for lethal and sublethal toxicity. In the F1 medaka, the LOECs for sublethal toxicity and estrogenic effects were 224 and < or = 51.1 microg/L, respectively. This finding suggests that the continuous exposure to 4-PP over two generations induced these adverse effects at lower concentrations in the F1 generation than those in the F0 generation. Thus, 4-PP has estrogenic effects that reduce the reproductive potential of medaka. The results indicate that the FFLC with medaka is applicable to the evaluation of weak estrogens.
Repeated dose oral toxicological evaluation of concentrated barley beta-glucan in CD-1 mice including a recovery phase.	The cholesterol-lowering effect observed following consumption of oats and barley is attributable to the beta-glucan component of the soluble fiber fraction of these cereal grains. beta-Glucan has also been reported to modulate immune activity, however, few studies have evaluated the hematological effects of beta-glucan following oral exposure. In the current study, a concentrated beta-glucan (64%) preparation from barley (Barley Betafiber) was blended into mouse feed at concentrations of 1, 5, or 10% (corresponding to approximately 0.7, 3.5, and 7% beta-glucan) and evaluated in CD-1 mice. Plasma was collected for clinical chemistry and hematological measurements at the initiation of the study and again following 14 and 28 days of exposure. Plasma was also collected from animals that consumed the same diets for 28-days but were switched to control diet (containing no supplemental beta-glucan) for an additional 14-day period to evaluate reversibility or delayed occurrence of treatment-related changes. Half of the animals were sacrificed for histopathologic analysis following the 28-day exposure period and the other half were evaluated following the recovery period. Histopathologic analysis focused on primary lymphoid organs and lymph nodes proximal and distal to the route of exposure. An additional group of untreated animals (nai;ve) was bled and sacrificed at day 0, 14, 27 and 41 for comparison of the hematology parameters with those of the control group because it was not known if multiple blood draws would affect hematology parameters. Compared to animals consuming the control diet, no treatment-related adverse effects were observed in hematological or clinical chemistry measurements or in organ weights and immunopathology in either sex following consumption of concentrated barley beta-glucan for 28-days or following the recovery period. Likewise, no differences were observed between the nai;ve and control groups. Results from this study showed that consumption of concentrated barley beta-glucan did not cause treatment-related inflammatory or other adverse effects in CD-1 mice.
An assessment of the phototoxic hazard of a personal product ingredient using in vitro assays.	Where substances are intended for use in personal products applied to the skin an assessment of potential phototoxic hazard is required. This report describes a tiered testing strategy involving in vitro assays used for the phototoxic hazard assessment of a personal product ingredient (Ingredient X). The initial assay was measurement of a UV/visible absorption spectrum to identify absorption at relevant wavelengths. This was followed by in vitro assays for phototoxicity (3T3 cell neutral red uptake phototoxicity test) and photoallergy (photobinding to human serum albumin). These in vitro screens gave equivocal results for Ingredient X which appeared to suggest a weak phototoxic reaction. To further evaluate the phototoxic hazard of Ingredient X to human skin, a phototoxicity assay using a 3-D human skin model was conducted. Ingredient X did not cause phototoxicity in this assay. Overall conclusions from these studies were that although Ingredient X showed slight intrinsic potential for photoactivation, it was unlikely to present a hazard to human skin. This report illustrates the value in a step-wise strategy of the use of human skin models to help interpret the results of other in vitro phototoxicity assays.
Evaluation of reproductive development following intravenous and oral exposure to DEHP in male neonatal rats.	Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) was administered to 3- to 5-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats by daily intravenous injections of 60, 300, or 600 mg/kg/day or by daily oral gavage of 300 or 600 mg/kg/day for 21 days. Histopathological evaluation and organ weight measurements were performed on some animals after 21 days of dosing (primary group) and later on the recovery group animals that were held without further treatment until sexual maturity at approximately 90 days of age. No effects of any type were observed in animals treated intravenously with 60 mg/kg/day. Testicular changes, consisting of a partial depletion of the germinal epithelium and/or decrease in diameter of seminiferous tubules, were present in all animals of the 300- and 600-mg/kg/day groups after the 21-day dosing period. Testes weight decreased and liver weight increased in these animals. Testes changes were dose-related and generally more severe among animals dosed orally versus intravenously. In the recovery animals, a residual DEHP-induced decrease in seminiferous tubule diameter was present in the testis of several animals dosed orally at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day, but not in animals dosed intravenously. There was no germinal cell depletion or Sertoli cell alteration observed in any dose group at any time. Notably, no effects on sperm count, sperm morphology, or sperm motility were observed at 90 days of age in any of the groups.
Effects of oral administration of manganese on the kidneys and urinary bladder of Sprague-Dawley rats.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of oral administration of manganese acetate on the kidneys and urinary bladder of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Male and female SD rats (150 to 175 g), 6 weeks old, were administered varying doses of manganese acetate for 63 days by oral gavage. At the end of 63 days, 50% of the animals were sacrificed and kidney tissue was isolated and fixed for histopathological studies (study A). The remaining 50% were cross-mated and dosing ceased. Animals were sacrificed after 2 weeks (study B). Male treated animals were noted to have viscous, gritty urine in the urinary bladder, and the high-dose groups had urinary bladder stones (uroliths). Histopathologically, the most striking lesions were observed in the kidneys and prostate glands of male animals. Mild-to-moderate tubulointerstitial nephritis with tubular proteineous and glomerulosclerosis was observed in animals of all treatment groups. Urolithiasis in the urinary bladder was confirmed in 33% to 66% of treated animals. Female animals did not show a significant difference above controls in renal tissues. Results of this study suggest that male rats are more sensitive to the effects of high levels of manganese given orally than female rats and that the genitourinary structures represent target organs of toxicity.
Final report on the safety assessment of aluminum silicate, calcium silicate, magnesium aluminum silicate, magnesium silicate, magnesium trisilicate, sodium magnesium silicate, zirconium silicate, attapulgite, bentonite, Fuller's earth, hectorite, kaolin, lithium magnesium silicate, lithium magnesium sodium silicate, montmorillonite, pyrophyllite, and zeolite.	This report reviews the safety of Aluminum, Calcium, Lithium Magnesium, Lithium Magnesium Sodium, Magnesium Aluminum, Magnesium, Sodium Magnesium, and Zirconium Silicates, Magnesium Trisilicate, Attapulgite, Bentonite, Fuller's Earth, Hectorite, Kaolin, Montmorillonite, Pyrophyllite, and Zeolite as used in cosmetic formulations. The common aspect of all these claylike ingredients is that they contain silicon, oxygen, and one or more metals. Many silicates occur naturally and are mined; yet others are produced synthetically. Typical cosmetic uses of silicates include abrasive, opacifying agent, viscosity-increasing agent, anticaking agent, emulsion stabilizer, binder, and suspending agent. Clay silicates (silicates containing water in their structure) primarily function as adsorbents, opacifiers, and viscosity-increasing agents. Pyrophyllite is also used as a colorant. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has ruled Attapulgite fibers >5 microm as possibly carcinogenic to humans, but fibers <5 microm were not classified as to their carcinogenicity to humans. Likewise, Clinoptilolite, Phillipsite, Mordenite, Nonfibrous Japanese Zeolite, and synthetic Zeolites were not classified as to their carcinogenicity to humans. These ingredients are not significantly toxic in oral acute or short-term oral or parenteral toxicity studies in animals. Inhalation toxicity, however, is readily demonstrated in animals. Particle size, fibrogenicity, concentration, and mineral composition had the greatest effect on toxicity. Larger particle size and longer and wider fibers cause more adverse effects. Magnesium Aluminum Silicate was a weak primary skin irritant in rabbits and had no cumulative skin irritation in guinea pigs. No gross effects were reported in any of these studies. Sodium Magnesium Silicate had no primary skin irritation in rabbits and had no cumulative skin irritation in guinea pigs. Hectorite was nonirritating to the skin of rabbits in a Draize primary skin irritation study. Magnesium Aluminum Silicate and Sodium Magnesium Silicate caused minimal eye irritation in a Draize eye irritation test. Bentonite caused severe iritis after injection into the anterior chamber of the eyes of rabbits and when injected intralamellarly, widespread corneal infiltrates and retrocorneal membranes were recorded. In a primary eye irritation study in rabbits, Hectorite was moderately irritating without washing and practically nonirritating to the eye with a washout. Rats tolerated a single dose of Zeolite A without any adverse reaction in the eye. Calcium Silicate had no discernible effect on nidation or on maternal or fetal survival in rabbits. Magnesium Aluminum Silicate had neither a teratogenic nor adverse effects on the mouse fetus. Female rats receiving a 20% Kaolin diet exhibited maternal anemia but no significant reduction in birth weight of the pups was recorded. Type A Zeolite produced no adverse effects on the dam, embryo, or fetus in either rats or rabbits at any dose level. Clinoptilolite had no effect on female rat reproductive performance. These ingredients were not genotoxic in the Ames bacterial test system. In primary hepatocyte cultures, the addition of Attapulgite had no significant unscheduled DNA synthesis. Attapulgite did cause significant increases in unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat pleural mesothelial cells, but no significant increase in sister chromosome exchanges were seen. Zeolite particles (<10 microm) produced statistically significant increase in the percentage of aberrant metaphases in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and cells collected by peritoneal lavage from exposed mice. Topical application of Magnesium Aluminum Silicate to human skin daily for 1 week produced no adverse effects. Occupational exposure to mineral dusts has been studied extensively. Fibrosis and pneumoconiosis have been documented in workers involved in the mining and processing of Aluminum Silicate, Calcium Silicate, Zirconium Silicate, Fuller's Earth, Kaolin, Montmorillonite, Pyrophyllite, and Zeolite. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel concluded that the extensive pulmonary damage in humans was the result of direct occupational inhalation of the dusts and noted that lesions seen in animals were affected by particle size, fiber length, and concentration. The Panel considers that most of the formulations are not respirable and of the preparations that are respirable, the concentration of the ingredient is very low. Even so, the Panel considered that any spray containing these solids should be formulated to minimize their inhalation. With this admonition to the cosmetics industry, the CIR Expert Panel concluded that these ingredients are safe as currently used in cosmetic formulations. The Panel did note that the cosmetic ingredient, Talc, is a hydrated magnesium silicate. Because it has a unique crystalline structure that differs from ingredients addressed in this safety assessment, Talc is not included in this report.
In vitro toxicity of indoor Chaetomium Kunze ex Fr.	Microscopic fungi in the indoor environment present a serious health risk for people living in affected buildings. The potentially toxic ascomycete genus Chaetomium is supposed to be the third most frequent indoor fungal contaminant. Its brief mycological, toxicological and ecological characterization is given. The work was aimed at in vitro study of toxicity of endo- and exometabolites of 14 strains of Chaetomium spp., including 4 strains of Ch. globosum, isolated from mouldy buildings in Slovakia and Denmark, and 3 Ch. globosum strains from the Czechoslovak Collection of Microorganisms (CCM). The endometabolites of 10 isolates of Chaetomium spp. were active: 7 isolates (41% of total strain number) stopped tracheal ciliary movement of 1-d-old chickens after 24 h, 9 isolates (53%) after 48 h and 10 strains (59%) after 72 h. In the case of exometabolites, the extracts of 6 Chaetomium strains showed some ciliostatic activity: 2 isolates (12% of strains tested) after 24 h, 5 isolates (29%) after 48 h and 6 isolates (35%) after 72 h. In general, 5 isolates of Danish origin (83%) produced ciliostatically active exometabolites and 2 isolates (33%) produced such endometabolites, while only 4 strains isolated in Slovakia (50%) and 3 strains (37%) respectively did the same under experimental conditions. Most toxic metabolites were produced by Chaetomium spp. isolated from dwellings, whereas hospital isolates were not able to produce active compounds. Chaetomia as indoor contaminants can contribute to ill health of occupants of mouldy damp buildings.
On the complexity of directed biological networks.	Recently there was an increased interest towards network approach to biology and environmental sciences. Networks are believed to be the key to the understanding of the work of biological machine in cells, organs, organisms, and ecosystems. While complexity of undirected networks has been recently analyzed, the assessment of complexity in directed networks has specificity that has not been explored so far. The present paper aims to address the existing gap by discussing the applicability of the available complexity descriptors. New specific measures (vertex accessibility, accessible connectedness, and adjusted average distance) are introduced based on assessment of the reduced accessibility of nodes in directed networks.
Epigenetic toxicity of hydroxylated biphenyls and hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls on normal rat liver epithelial cells.	2-Biphenylol, 3-biphenylol, 2,2'-biphenyldiol, 3,3'-biphenyldiol, 3-chloro-2-biphenylol, and 4,4'-dichloro-3-biphenylol were evaluated using the scrape-loading/dye transfer (SL/ DT) technique to determine in vitro gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in a normal rat liver epithelial cell line as a measure of the epigenetic toxicity. Cytotoxicity was determined using the neutral red uptake assay. A dose range of 0-300 microM was examined. Only 3,3'-biphenyldiol and 4,4'-dichloro-3-biphenylol induced cytotoxicity within the tested dose ranges. Noncytotoxic doses were selected for evaluation of epigenetic toxicity. 4,4'-Dichloro-3-biphenylol was most inhibitory to GJIC at the lowest dose. The cytotoxicity and GJIC inhibitory effects observed for 4,4'-dichloro-3-biphenylol might be, although not exclusively, a consequence of the lipophilic nature of this chemical. 3-Chloro-2-biphenylol was least inhibitory to GJIC. 3-Chloro-2-biphenylol was less inhibitory to GJIC than 2-biphenylol because of the presence of the chlorine functional group, which appears to attenuate the toxic effect of the ortho-hydroxyl group. Although cells were capable of complete recovery of GJIC after removal of each of the chemicals, only with 2,2'-biphenyldiol and 4,4,'-dichloro-3-biphenylol did the cells demonstrate partial recovery without removal of the chemical. The more noncoplanar conformation of 2,2'-biphenyldiol and 2-biphenylol might explain their more inhibitory behavior in comparison to 3,3'-biphenyldiol and 3-biphenylol, respectively.
Cytotoxicity of RH1 and related aziridinylbenzoquinones: involvement of activation by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) and oxidative stress.	It is supposed that the main cytotoxicity mechanism of antitumour aziridinyl-substituted benzoquinones is their two-electron reduction to alkylating products by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1, DT-diaphorase, EC 1.6.99.2). However, other possible cytotoxicity mechanisms, e.g., oxidative stress, are studied insufficiently. In the single-electron reduction of quinones including a novel compound RH1 (2,5-diaziridinyl- 3-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone), by NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase (EC 1.6.2.4, P-450R), their reactivity increased with an increase in the redox potential of quinone/semiquinone couple (E(1)7), reaching a limiting value at E(1)7> or =-0.1V. The reactivity of quinones towards NQO1 did not depend on their E(1)7. The cytotoxicity of aziridinyl-unsubstituted quinones in bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line FLK) mimics their reactivity in P-450R-catalyzed reactions, exhibiting a parabolic dependence on their E(1)7. The toxicity of aziridinyl-benzoquinones, although being higher, also followed this trend and did not depend on their reactivity towards NQO1. The action of aziridinylbenzoquinones in FLK cells was accompanied by an increase in lipid peroxidation, their toxicity decreased by desferrioxamine and the antioxidant N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylene diamine, and potentiated by 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea. The inhibitor of NQO1, dicumarol, protected against the toxicity of aziridinyl-benzoquinones except of 2,5-bis-(2'-hydroxyethylamino)-3,6-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinone (BZQ), which was almost inactive as NQO1 substrate. The same events except the absence of pronounced effect of dicumarol were characteristic in the cytotoxicity of aziridinyl-unsubstituted quinones. These findings indicate that in addition to the activation by NQO1, the oxidative stress presumably initiated by single-electron transferring enzymes may be an important factor in the cytotoxicity of aziridinylbenzoquinones. The information obtained may contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aziridinylquinone cytotoxicity and may be useful in the design of future bioreductive drugs.
Hazard identification of pharmaceutical wastewaters using biodegradability studies.	A reliable wastewater characterization is an integral part of treatment and management strategies for industrial effluents. This is especially true for the pharmaceutical industry, which exhibits significant differences in its line of activity, generating effluents of very specific and complex natures. Any hazard or risk assessment of wastewater and/or determination of its treatability must include an evaluation of its degradability. Usually various non-standardized laboratory or pilot-scale long-term tests are run by measuring summary parameters for several days to determine the biodegradation potential of the effluent. A complex approach, based on stabilization studies, was proposed to determine the hazardous impact of wastewaters in terms of biodegradable and persistent toxicity. The objective of our work was to carry out complex hazard evaluation of pharmaceutical wastewaters. Whole effluent toxicity was determined using two different toxicity tests. First, we measured the inhibition of oxygen consumption by activated sludge. The test indicated toxicity of the wastewater and thus we performed an additional acute toxicity test with luminescent bacteria Vibrio fisheri. The next step was the determination of whole effluent ready biodegradability. It was determined with simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption (ISO 9804) and carbon dioxide production (ISO 9439) in a closed respirometer, accompanied by DOC/IC measurements. The pharmaceutical wastewater degraded readily (83%, lag phase was 2 days, biodegradation rate was 0.33999 day(-1)) on the basis of O2 measurements. The biodegradation, calculated from the CO2 measurements, was comparable. We also applied mass balances of DOC/IC at the beginning and at the end of biodegradation experiments to confirm the extent and rate of biodegradation. The determination of hazardous impact and treatability of the effluent was concluded with aerobic stabilization studies. Biodegradation of the wastewater during the study was followed by relevant biochemical analysis and DOC/IC mass balance.
Safety evaluation of phytosterol esters. Part 8. Lack of genotoxicity and subchronic toxicity with phytosterol oxides.	Vegetable oil spreads containing phytosterol-esters are marketed as a cholesterol-lowering functional food in more than 20 countries worldwide. An extensive package of safety data has shown phytosterol-esters to be safe for human use. However, even though phytosterols are very stable molecules, oxidation may occur at low levels under extreme heating conditions, resulting in phytosterol oxides. As there is some suggestion of adverse biological effects in the literature for the related cholesterol oxidation products, safety data have been generated for phytosterol oxides. A phytosterol oxide concentrate (POC) was generated by prolonged heating of phytosterol-esters in the presence of oxygen. The genotoxicity and subchronic toxicity of this mixture was assessed in a series of in vitro genotoxicity assays (bacterial mutation, chromosome aberration and micronucleus) and a subchronic feeding study in the rat. Results showed that a phytosterol oxide concentrate containing approximately 30% phytosterol oxides did not possess genotoxic potential and no obvious evidence of toxicity when administered in the diet of the rat for 90 consecutive days. In the latter study, a NOEL was established at an estimated dietary level of phytosterol oxides of 128 mg/kg/day for males and 144 mg/kg/day for females. In conclusion, these materials have been shown to raise no obvious concerns for human safety.
Evaluation of the oral subchronic toxicity of AHTN (7-Acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) in the rat.	7-Acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (AHTN) is used as a fragrance material in a wide variety of consumer products. Because of its widespread exposure, a 90-day oral feeding study, with 4-week recovery periods for selected rats, was conducted. AHTN was added to the diet of rats at levels calculated to result in mean daily doses of 1.5, 5, 15 or 50 mg AHTN/kg body weight/day. On completion of the treatment period, 3 males and 3 females from each of the high dose groups and controls were maintained for a treatment free period of 4 weeks. There were no adverse effects revealed upon clinical examination or following extensive histopathological examinations. Histopathological examination of the prostate, seminal vesicles, mammary gland and testes of males and ovaries, mammary gland, uterus and vagina of females, undertaken on all animals in all test groups, revealed no evidence of hormonal effects of AHTN. A statistically significant decrease in body weight gain was observed in both sexes in the high dose group only. Statistically significant effects were observed in hematology and blood chemistry, although these effects were all within the range for historical controls and were not proportional to dose. A green to dark brown coloration in the livers and mesenteric lymph nodes was also seen in high dose animals. At the end of the treatment-free period, the color change was almost completely reversed; one high dose male still had green colored lymph nodes, but the liver appeared normal. A green coloration of the lacrimal glands in females, but not males, was also seen in 8/12, 4/15 and in 1 female given 50, 15 and 5 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively. This green color was still present in 2/3 of the high dose females after the treatment-free period. Microscopic examination of unstained sections of frozen livers under UV illumination did not reveal any fluorescence that might have been consistent with porphyrin accumulation. These findings were clearly related to administration of AHTN, but were not accompanied by any histopathological changes. In discolored livers, all fractions of liver homogenate were abnormally colored; the change was most prominent in the mitochondria. Some dissolved pigment was obtained by extraction of liver homogenates with DMSO/trichloroacetic acid mixtures, but its identity remains to be established. Further work on the mechanism of production of the abnormal color is in progress. Based on these results, the 90-day conservative no-observed-effect level (NOAEL) is 1.5 mg/kg body weight/day.
Oxidative stress responses in two populations of Laeonereis acuta (Polychaeta, Nereididae) after acute and chronic exposure to copper.	Acute (4 days) and chronic (14 days) effects of copper were evaluated on the antioxidant defenses of Laeonereis acuta (Polychaeta) collected in unpolluted (UP) and polluted (P) sites. In the acute assay (125 and 250 micro g Cu/l) superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities did not change, whereas catalase (CAT) increased in worms from both the sites. Lipid peroxidation was higher in copper exposed worms from the P site. In the chronic assay (62.5 micro g Cu/l) polychaetes from the P site showed enhanced activities of SOD, GST and CAT and higher contents of metallothionein-like proteins and sulfhydrils compared to worms from UP. Differences in responses between polychaetes from UP and P sites suggest that organisms from the polluted site, P, are more susceptible to oxidative stress conditions.
A bispecific immunotoxin (DTAT13) targeting human IL-13 receptor (IL-13R) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) in a mouse xenograft model.	A bispecific immunotoxin (IT) called DTAT13 was synthesized in order to target simultaneously the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)-expressing tumor neovasculature and IL-13 receptor expressing glioblastoma cells with the goal of intratumoral administration for brain tumors. The recombinant hybrid was created using the non-internalizing N-terminal fragment (ATF) of uPA and the IL-13 molecule for binding plus the catalytic and translocation portion of diphtheria toxin (DT) for killing. The 71 kDa protein was highly selective for human glioblastoma in vitro showing no loss on binding compared with DTAT and DTIL13 controls. In vivo, DTAT13 caused the regression of small tumors when administered at 10 micro g/day given on a five-dose schedule every other day. DTAT13 was able to target both overexpressed uPAR and the vasculature, as demonstrated by its ability to kill HUVEC cells. Also, mortality studies indicated that DTAT13 was less toxic than DTAT or DTIL13. These findings indicate that bispecific IT may allow treatment of a broader subset of antigenically diverse patients while simultaneously reducing the exposure to toxin required than if two separate agents were employed.
Neurotoxicity of active compounds--establishment of hESC-lines and proteomics technologies for human embryo- and neurotoxicity screening and biomarker identification.	Pharmaceutical and chemical industries are facing new challenges for hazard and risk assessment from regulatory agencies. Especially for potential embryotoxicity of active compounds, conclusions from animal testing remain problematic due to numerous species-specific effects. Developmental toxicity screening preferentially should be performed with human material. Appropriate models are scarce or missing, and the development of a human in vitro model for the molecular characterisation of embryotoxic effects appears to be highly desirable. The outstanding advantages of a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) based in vitro screening model for embryonic neurotoxicity become clear from corresponding results from a murine ESC-screening system. This in vitro test system is based on neuronal differentiated murine embryonic stem cells and quantitative differential proteomic display techniques to identify biomarkers for neurotoxicity. Results are superior to those of conventional array technologies (nucleic acids), because the proteomic analysis covers posttranslational modifications. Under the new strict guidelines for stem cell importation of the German Ministry of Health and a Central Ethics Commission for Stem Cell Research, it is now possible for the first time to exploit the outstanding features of human embryonic stem cells to establish an innovative screening method for embryo- and neurotoxicity and to identify toxicity biomarkers without using animal-based in vitro or in vivo systems.
The endocrine and reproductive system: adverse effects of hormonally active substances?	Chemicals that have the intrinsic property to modulate or even disrupt the endocrine system are present in the human environment. Because it is the potency of such chemicals that determines the toxicologic relevance, assessment of the risk to human health must consider both the endocrine disrupting potential and the potency. Usually in vitro assays are applied to detect the potential of a hormone-like effect, and such data are considered useful to set priorities for additional testing and for mechanistic studies. However, such data allow only determination of relative potency of a chemical as compared with other xenobiotics, natural compounds, or endogenous hormones. Relevant information on the endocrine-disrupting potency can be taken only from in vivo assays, eg, the Hershberger (male reproductive organs) and uterotrophic (female reproductive organs) assays, the updated versions of the 28- and 90-day toxicity studies in rodents, and the 2-generation studies in rodents. With the use of this information and the concentration of these chemicals in humans, the potency of the effect as compared with endogenous hormone activity can be estimated. So far, the relative potencies of chemicals tested in in vitro systems as compared with estradiol are several orders of magnitude smaller, whereas potency of the phytoestrogen, eg, isoflavones such as genistein or daidzein, can even exceed that of estradiol, especially in infants who are fed soy-based formula as a sole source of nutrition. Although there are still open questions regarding in utero or early postnatal exposure, the low potencies and concentrations of manmade chemicals as compared with the endogenous hormones in humans make it unlikely that adverse effects occur at common exposure.
Genotoxicity modulation by cadmium treatment: studies in the Drosophila wing spot test.	The genotoxic activity of cadmium chloride (CC) has been evaluated in the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, its possible modulating effect on the genotoxicity of two known mutagenic agents, potassium dichromate (PDC) and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), was investigated. Three different types of combined treatments of CC with the two genotoxins were performed: pretreatment, cotreatment, and posttreatment. The SMART assay is based on the principle that loss of heterozygosity for the recessive markers, multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare-3 (flr(3)), leads to the formation of mutant clones in the imaginal disks of larvae, which are expressed as mutant spots on the wings of adult flies. Thus, after adult emergence, the wings of the adult flies were scored for the presence of single and/or twin spots. Our results show that CC alone was not effective in increasing the frequency of any of the three categories of spots (small, large, and twin). In the cotreatment experiments, CC increased the genotoxicity of PDC but it decreased the genotoxicity of EMS. No effects of CC were observed in the pretreatment or posttreatment experiments; however, only low concentrations of CC, PDC, and EMS were tested in the pretreatment assays due to the high toxicity of the treatment. Although our results with PDC are consistent with the hypothesis that cadmium can interfere with repair mechanisms, the EMS data suggest that other modulating mechanisms are also involved in the genotoxicity of this metal.
An overview of the effects of tobacco ingredients on smoke chemistry and toxicity.	This paper presents an overview of a series of studies designed to assess the influence of 482 tobacco ingredients on cigarette smoke chemistry and toxicity. The studies are: pyrolysis of the ingredients; influence of the ingredients on smoke constituents believed by regulatory authorities to be relevant to smoking-related diseases ("Hoffmann analytes"); influence of the ingredients on in vitro genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of smoke partiulate matter; and influence of the ingredients on the inhalation toxicity of smoke. The present paper brings the salient features of these studies together. A pyrolysis technique has been developed which, as far as practicably possible, mimics the combustion conditions inside a burning cigarette. The results from 291 single-substance ingredients indicate that almost a third would transfer out of the cigarette burning zone at least 99% intact (i.e. less than 1% pyrolysis), and almost two thirds would transfer at least 95% intact. Of the ingredients that underwent some degree of pyrolysis, a few "Hoffmann analytes" were detected amongst the pyrolysis products of 19 ingredients. Taking into account maximum use levels, their maximum pyrolysis levels were generally small and often insignificant compared to the levels typically present in smoke. Possible exceptions were acetaldehyde and benzene from the pyrolysis of malic acid. However, subsequent smoke chemistry studies indicated that the maximum levels predicted from pyrolysis of this involatile substance were overestimated, suggesting that malic acid does not undergo complete pyrolysis in the burning cigarette and/or generates acetaldehyde and benzene at similar rates to that of tobacco on a per weight basis. When added to tobacco, many of the ingredient mixtures produced no significant effect on the levels of many of the "Hoffmann analytes" in smoke, while some produced increases or decreases relative to the relevant control cigarettes. The study has concentrated on the increases. Many of the differences were found to be not significant when the long-term variability of the analytical methodology was taken into account. However, even taking this into account, the smoke formaldehyde levels in two of the test cigarettes were significantly increased relative to their controls, by up to 26 microg (73%). These increases are likely to be due to the pyrolysis of sugars, cellulose and other polysaccharide materials. The activity of smoke particulate matter from cigarettes containing tobacco ingredients has been determined with three in vitro bioassays, two for genotoxicity and one for cytotoxicity. These were the Ames test, the mammalian cell micronucleus assay, and the neutral red uptake cytotoxicity assay. Within the sensitivity and specificity of these bioassays, the specific activity of the cigarette smoke particulate matter was not changed by the addition of ingredients to the cigarette. Three 90-day sub-chronic inhalation studies have been undertaken and histopathological and histomorphometric assessments made within the respiratory tracts of animals exposed to smoke from cigarettes containing the various ingredient mixtures and their control cigarettes. The response due to tobacco smoke exposure was not distinguishable between the test and control cigarettes, indicating that the presence of the ingredients had made no discernable differences to the type and severity of the treatment-related changes.
Ecotoxicity assessment of stabilized/solidified foundry sludge.	The aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of the leachates from a foundry sludge and the derived products based on the stabilization/solidification (S/S) processes. Foundry sludge is an industrial hazardous waste containing inorganic and organic pollutants. The immobilization of the foundry waste has been performed using different S/S procedures based on cement or lime as binder agents and foundry sand fines, calcium-magnesium lignosulfonate, silica fume, activated carbon and black carbon as additives. The waste and stabilized/solidified derived products have been evaluated according to environmental considerations. The relation between the chemical composition and the ecotoxicity of the leachates has been studied in this paper. The ecotoxicity of the leachates has been related to the heavy metals and the organic pollutants by an empirical logarithmic linear expression. Different parameters of the logarithmic fitting have been obtained for the studied binder agents and additives allowing the establishment of a relationship between the S/S process and the ecotoxicity of the derived products. Results of this study have wide-ranging implications for immediate management strategies of waste with organic and inorganic pollutants in addition to application in long-term remediation efforts.
Time and moisture effects on total and bioavailable copper in soil water extracts.	Environmental risk assessment of heavy metals in soil frequently involves testing of freshly spiked soils kept under stable humidity conditions, but it has been questioned whether these assessments are representative of the field situation. Furthermore, the poor correspondence that is often found between total metal content and metal toxicity calls for integrated chemical and biological analysis. The aim of this work was to determine time- and moisture-dependent changes in total water-extractable Cu as well as bioavailable Cu in soil water extracts. Measurements of total water-extractable copper ([Cu]tot) were performed using furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. An in vitro assay employing a Cu-specific Pseudomonas fluorescens reporter strain was used to estimate Cu that was biologically available to the reporter strain. We refer to this copper fraction as "bioavailable," [Cu]bio. We found a time-dependent decrease in [Cu]tot and [Cu]bio during incubation for up to 220 d at field capacity. Hence the [Cu]bio was reduced to between 32 and 40% of the initial values. Furthermore, the [Cu]bio to [Cu]tot ratio correlated positively with the amount of added Cu and tended to increase with time. The moisture content of the soil was important for Cu retention. Dry soil had higher [Cu]tot concentrations than humid soil, but the [Cu]bio to [Cu]tot, ratio was lower in the dry soil. Alternating drying and wetting did not lead to a more rapid Cu retention than observed under constant humid conditions. Our observations underline the need for considering both time and moisture effects when interpreting short-term toxicity studies and when making predictions concerning possible long-term effects of Cu in the soil environment.
Application of electro-Fenton oxidation for the detoxification of olive mill wastewater phenolic compounds.	Olive mill wastewaters are powerful pollutants that are difficult to treat as they contain high concentrations of recalcitrant and toxic polyphenolics of different molecular masses. We report in this paper that pre-treatment of phenolic fractions extracted from olive mill wastewaters as well as a synthetic phenolic mixture by the electro-Fenton method is a highly efficient procedure in which low mass phenolics are polymerised to polyphenolics and removed by precipitation. This decreases the toxicity load by 78% and makes the waste amenable to further anaerobic post-treatment.
Dependence of the cellular internalization and transfection efficiency on the structure and physicochemical properties of cationic detergent/DNA/liposomes.	Control of the structure and physicochemical properties of DNA complexed with nonviral vectors is essential for efficient biodistribution and gene delivery to cells. Cationic liposomes interact with DNA giving transfection competent but large and heterogeneous aggregates. On the other hand, cationic detergents condense DNA into small homogeneous but reversible complexes inefficient for transfection.
Multiple dose toxicity study of the humanized anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody h-R3 intravenously administered to Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus monkeys.	The h-R3 is a humanized growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody (mAb) in development for the treatment of head and neck tumours in which malignant cells overexpress the Epidermal Growth Factor receptor. The present study was designed to evaluate the toxicity of repeated intravenous doses of the h-R3 mAb in a relevant species demonstrated by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase immunohistochemical (IHC) technique in skin biopsy samples from three Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus monkeys (green monkeys). Additionally, 18 green monkeys were daily intravenously treated during 14 consecutive days. Monkeys were distributed into three experimental groups with three animals of each sex in each group. Group I received saline solution and served as control group; group II received 2.85 mg/kg of h-R3 mAb; and group III received 11.4 mg/kg of the h-R3 mAb. During the study there were no deaths, neither pathological clinical signs, or variations in the corporal weight curve. The electroneurophysiological and sanguine chemistry results did not evidence alterations related to the assay substance. Areas of haematomas, haemorrhages and inflammation, probably related with the administration procedure, were observed at the administration zones of all animals; this fact could also explain the increase in the neutrophil count of all animals at the end of the study. The electrocardiography study showed that in the 14 days of the study one female monkey, from the higher dose group, shifted its cardiac axis from +60 degrees to + 120 degrees; this finding could be interpreted as a right ventricular elongation due to the relative high daily administered volume. It is concluded that doses up to 11.4 mg/kg of h-R3, intravenously administered during 14 consecutive days to Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus monkeys do not produce considerable toxic effects in the studied system.
Developmental effects of propyphenazone in analgesic and antipyretic combination with caffeine or paracetamol.	The aim of the study was to determine the influence of an over-the-counter (OTC) mixture of propyphenazone with caffeine or paracetamol on prenatal development. Propyphenazone:caffeine and propyphenazone:paracetamol mixtures were prepared with constant 3:1 and 3:5 ratios, respectively. Three dose levels of each of the mixtures were administered separately in Tween-80 water suspension once a day to pregnant Wistar rats on gestation days 8-14. The low dose was similar to the OTC preparations, 2.1 mg/kg of propyphenazone, 0.7 mg/kg of caffeine or 3.5 mg/kg of paracetamol. The middle dose was 21.0, 7.0 or 35.0 mg/kg, and the highest 210.0, 70.0 or 350.0 mg/kg for propyphenazone, caffeine or paracetamol, respectively. On day 21 of gestation the fetuses were delivered by hysterectomy. Dead or live fetuses, resorptions and the number of implantation sites were counted. Live fetuses were examined for external, visceral and skeletal malformation. Postimplantation mortality was calculated. Dose-dependent effects in the middle and high dose groups on fetal body weight/length and placental weight were found. No increase in external or internal congenital anomalies was found in any of the mixture-exposed groups. Prenatal coadministration of propyphenazone with caffeine or paracetamol caused intrauterine growth retardation but did not increase external or internal congenital anomalies. The risk of midline defects (umbilical hernia and gastroschisis) is discussed.
Avoidance of copper contamination by field populations of Daphnia longispina.	Almost all terrestrial and aquatic assays that are accepted as standardized, or that have been proposed, involve the exposure of confined organisms to toxicants. If avoidance (sensu evasion, displacement) of contaminants occurs in real situations, then bioassays involving forced exposure severely underestimate pernicious effects of contamination. Two main objectives were achieved in this study: To verify the occurrence of avoidance of copper by cladocerans; to determine the association between avoidance and other toxicity endpoints (lethality and feeding depression), and therefore, to ascertain if fully acclimated individuals from a reference field population exhibited a genetically determined avoidance markedly different from those belonging to a historically metal-stressed population. Twelve cloned lineages of the cladoceran Daphnia longispina, collected from two field populations, were selected according to their lethal sensitivity to copper and acclimated to controlled conditions for more than 30 generations. A 1.1-m test chamber with five compartments was built, allowing the establishment of a dissolved toxicant gradient and the free movement of individuals. In the absence of any toxicant, juveniles from each cloned lineage distributed themselves randomly along the test chamber and furthermore, no significant differences were observed between the two replicates, attesting the repeatability of this novel assay. All lineages showed significant avoidance to copper when exposed to a gradient from 3 to 87 microg/L. The most sensitive lineages to lethal levels of copper began avoiding this metal earlier than resistant ones. An intense association was observed between other endpoints and avoidance; furthermore, avoidance was determined to be much more sensitive than lethality. Therefore, avoidance assays should be recommended as a complementary tool in ecological risk assessments and effluent biomonitoring because such assays can provide cost-effective and ecologically relevant information.
Effects of dietary zinc exposure on the life history of the parthenogenetic springtail Folsomia candida (Collembola: Isotomidae).	The effect of zinc on growth and reproduction of the springtail Folsomia candida has been determined for individual animals exposed to contaminated food. Zinc caused a decrease in growth of the springtails, which resulted in a decrease in the estimated final fresh weight at the highest exposure level (20 mg/g dry food). Other effects were observed from 5 mg/g dry food and included an increase of the juvenile period, an increase of development time, a reduction in first-clutch size and egg viability, and a reduction in the number of individuals reaching the reproductive state. The effect of these changes on the population growth rate was evaluated using an estimated value for mortality in the field. In the present analysis, the juvenile period was the most sensitive variable.
Growth and survival of five amphibian species exposed to combinations of pesticides.	The global decline of amphibians has sparked interest in the role that pesticides may play. Pesticides in nature typically exist in combinations, but given the vast number of chemicals used, most toxicological experiments necessarily have examined one pesticide at a time. I examined how four commercial formulations of pesticides (diazinon, carbaryl, malathion, and glyphosate) affected the survival and growth of five larval amphibian species (Rana pipiens, R. clamitans, R. catesbeiana, Bufo americanus, and Hyla versicolor) when alone (at 1 or 2 mg/L of active ingredient) and in pairwise combinations (1 mg/L of each pesticide). At 1 mg/L, the pesticides reduced survival in 5% of the 20 species-pesticide comparisons and reduced growth in 35% of the comparisons. At 2 mg/L, the pesticides had more widespread effects, reducing survival in 35% of the 20 species-pesticide comparisons and reducing growth in 70% of comparisons. Combined pesticides occasionally caused lower survival and growth than either pesticide alone, but the effects were never larger than the more deadly of the two pesticides alone at 2 mg/L. This suggests that the impact of combining these four pesticides is similar to that predicted by the total concentration of pesticides in the system.
Aquatic ecotoxicological indicators in life-cycle assessment.	This paper compares available options for the aquatic ecotoxicological effect factor component in life-cycle assessment (LCA). The effect factor is expressed here as the change in risk per unit change in cumulative exposure, delta effect/delta exposure. The comparison is restricted to approaches linked, implicitly as well as explicitly, to species-sensitivity distributions (SSDs). This draws on recent insights for chemical mixtures and identifies the implications of different model choices. In spite of the many options, assumptions, and areas for further research, it is concluded that a single effect factor basis represents the best available practice for use in LCA at this time, deltaPAF(ms)/deltaC = 0.5/HC50, where deltaPAF(ms) is the change in the (potentially affected) fraction (PAF) of species that experiences an increase in exposure above a specified effect level, accounting for the presence of complex background mixtures (ms), deltaC is the change in cumulative exposure concentration of the chemical of interest, and HC50 is the median, chronic hazardous concentration for regional, multiple-species systems. The resultant aquatic effect factors are risk-based and can be estimated readily for many chemicals using available methods, without the need to describe the entire SSDs and without the need for additional data. For example, the octanol-water partitioning coefficient provides a sufficient estimation basis for about 50% of existing chemicals that have a narcosis mode of action. This also is relevant in LCA for chemicals that are at low concentrations in the environment, concentrations below the biological thresholds at which more specific modes of action would be of relevance.
Development and evaluation of an in vitro model for the analysis of cigarette smoke effects on cultured cells and tissues.	Smokers have an increased risk for a variety of diseases. Among the most prominent is atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death in the Western world. Although this conjunction is accepted knowledge, the basic biological mechanisms and the identities of the active tobacco smoke constituents surprisingly are still unknown. One reason for this is the lack of accurate in vitro models.
Safety assessment of (-)-hydroxycitric acid and Super CitriMax, a novel calcium/potassium salt.	(-)-Hydroxycitric acid (HCA) is a principle constituent (10-30%) of the dried fruit rind of Garcinia cambogia, a plant native to Southeastern Asia. The dried rind has been used for centuries throughout Southeast Asia as a food preservative, flavoring agent and carminative. Extensive experimental studies show that HCA inhibits fat synthesis and reduces food intake. The objective of this review is to systematically review the available safety/toxicity literature on HCA to determine its safety in-use. The primary mechanism of action of HCA appears to be related to its ability to act as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme ATP-citrate lyase, which catalyzes the conversion of citrate and coenzyme A to oxaloacetate and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), primary building blocks of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Super CitriMax, a novel calcium/potassium-HCA extract (HCA-SX), is considerably more soluble and bioavailable than calcium-based HCA ingredients. Acute oral toxicity studies in animals demonstrate that CitriMax (50% HCA as calcium salt) has a low acute oral toxicity. In a subchronic study in rats, the gavage administration of HCA-SX at doses up to 2500 mg/kg/day for a period of 90 days caused a significant decrease in body weight and reduction in feed consumption without any adverse effects. The structure, mechanism of action, long history of use of HCA and other toxicity studies indicate that HCA-SX is unlikely to cause reproductive or developmental effects. HCA-SX was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activation in Ames genotoxicity assays in strains TA98 and TA102. HCA-SX-induced increases in number of revertants in other strains (TA100 and TA1535 in the absence of metabolic activation and in strain TA1537 in the presence of metabolic activation) but these were not considered as biologically indicative of a mutagenic effect. In several, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials employing up to 2800 mg/day HCA, no treatment-related adverse effects were reported. There is sufficient qualitative and quantitative scientific evidence, including animal and human data suggesting that intake of HCA at levels up to 2800 mg/day is safe for human consumption.
Preliminary ecotoxicological characterization of a new energetic substance, CL-20.	A new energetic substance hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (or CL-20) was tested for its toxicities to various ecological receptors. CL-20 (epsilon-polymorph) was amended to soil or deionized water to construct concentration gradients. Results of Microtox (15-min contact) and 96-h algae growth inhibition tests indicate that CL-20 showed no adverse effects on the bioluminescence of marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri and the cell density of freshwater green algae Selenastrum capricornutum respectively, up to its water solubility (ca. 3.6 mg l(-1)). CL-20 and its possible biotransformation products did not inhibit seed germination and early seedling (16-19 d) growth of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) up to 10,000 mg kg(-1) in a Sassafras sandy loam soil (SSL). Indigenous soil microorganisms in SSL and a garden soil were exposed to CL-20 for one or two weeks before dehydrogenase activity (DHA) or potential nitrification activity (PNA) were assayed. Results indicate that up to 10,000 mg kg(-1) soil of CL-20 had no statistically significant effects on microbial communities measured as DHA or on the ammonium oxidizing bacteria determined as PNA in both soils. Data indicates that CL-20 was not acutely toxic to the species or microbial communities tested and that further studies are required to address the potential long-term environmental impact of CL-20 and its possible degradation products.
The effects of endosulfan on the great ramshorn snail Planorbarius corneus (Gastropoda, Pulmonata): a histopathological study.	In this study the great ramshorn snail (Planorbarius corneus), one of the most abundant gastropod of Turkish limnic systems, was investigated to determine the histopathological effects of endosulfan on the digestive gland, foot and mantle under laboratory conditions. Samples were collected from small artificial pools in Karaot at Gelendost-Isparta (southwest of Turkey), where agricultural activities are widespread. The snails were exposed to two sublethal concentrations of endosulfan (0.4 and 0.8 mg/l) for periods of 10, 20 and 30 days. Fifteen snails were kept in 2.5 l glass jars containing dechlorinated tap water and exposed under semi-static test (daily exchange of test water). All the testing was carried out on adult specimens, and snails were maintained on a photothermal period with 16 light hours at 22 +/- 2 degrees C. The histopathological examinations revealed the following changes: amoebocytes infiltration, dilatation in hemolymphatic spaces between the tubules, degeneration of cells, abnormal lumen, necrosis of cells and atrophy in the connective tissue of digestive gland; desquamation of the epithelium cells, changes in the number of mucocytes and protein gland cells, lipid vacuolus and atrophy of the columnar muscle fibers of the foot and mantle tissues. Pycnotic state of cells was also seen in the mantle tissues. Endosulfan caused significant histopathological alterations in the digestive gland, foot and mantle tissues of the snail, irrespective of concentrations of the pesticide and its exposure periods. The results are discussed, particularly in comparison to those of other aquatic organisms.
Reduction in labile copper in the 7-day Ceriodaphnia dubia toxicity test due to the interaction with zooplankton food.	Due to the increased popularity of zooplankton toxicity tests, it is important to investigate potential confounding factors. Though zooplankton food has been studied extensively to meet the nutritional needs of the zooplankton, less research has been done on whether food addition reduces the toxicity of metals in the tested sample. This investigation combines toxicity tests and metal speciation analysis to determine whether the EPA recommended food of YCT (yeast, cerophyll, and trout chow) and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (formerly Selenastrum capricornutum) reduces copper toxicity by decreasing the concentration of labile copper. Toxicity tests were performed with Ceriodaphnia dubia on culture water spiked with 0, 787, and 1574 nM copper with five different food levels. A Chelex-100 cation exchange resin and a graphite furnace-atomic absorption spectrophotometer were used in conjunction with the toxicity tests to measure the amount of labile copper in the culture water. At the EPA recommended food dosage, the C. dubia food has a chelating capacity of approximately 500 nM Cu. For both concentrations of spiked culture water, the toxicity to C. dubia was reduced with increasing food level, which seemed to be both from a decrease in labile copper concentration and an increase in the nutritional condition of the zooplankton.
Geosmin occurrence in riverine cyanobacterial mats: is it causing a significant health hazard?	Toxicity endpoints (nonspecific cytotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and mutagenicity) were studied in cyanobacterial mats obtained from a shallow river. Some of the cyanobacterial mats tested were known to be non-geosmin producers, while others were geosmin-producers. No microcystin-like compounds were detected by HPLC in any of the biofilm samples. The mutagenicity and neurotoxicity of biofilm metabolites was negligible, and generally weak adverse effects of biofilm extracts detected in a battery of in-vitro assays indicated relatively low human health risks associated with biofilm toxicity. While the toxicity responses detected in the studied biofilms were weak, effects were not related to production of geosmin. It was therefore concluded that the production of this metabolite cannot be taken as an indication per se of the existence of a health hazard.
Anti-genotoxicity of coffee against N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in mouse lymphoma cells.	The main aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that instant coffee, a commonly consumed polyphenolic beverage with antioxidant activity, can protect mammalian cells against genotoxic effects in vitro. For this purpose, the L5178Y mouse lymphoma cell line was selected to assess modulatory effects of coffee on the genotoxicity of N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). We initiated the work with a set of preliminary experiments in which the cytokinesis-block micronucleus test was performed. Results obtained from these experiments demonstrated a dose-related decrease in genotoxicity following co-treatment of mouse lymphoma cells with three doses of caffeinated instant coffee. Both pre-treatment and co-treatment showed significant antigenotoxic effects against MNNG. Caffeinated and decaffeinated instant coffee samples inhibited genotoxicity. There was no significant change in the antigenotoxic effect of caffeinated instant coffee after filtration using a 0.2 microm filter. Similar in vitro experiments demonstrated antigenotoxic effects against MNNG when boiled coffee was used instead of instant coffee. On the basis of the findings from the above preliminary experiments, further work was carried out to evaluate the possible protective effects of caffeinated instant coffee against MNNG-induced DNA damage, mutation and chromosomal damage. Results from three or five independent experiments demonstrated significant protective effects of caffeinated instant coffee against MNNG-induced DNA damage in the comet assay, mutation at the Tk locus and chromosomal damage in the cytokinesis-block micronucleus test.
Toward non-toxic antifouling: synthesis of hydroxy-, cinnamic acid-, sulfate-, and zosteric acid-labeled poly[3-hydroxyalkanoates].	The side-chain double bonds of bacterial poly[3-hydroxyalkanoate-co-3-hydroxyalkenoate] (PHAE, 1) were transformed into thioether bonds (derivative 2) via the radical addition reaction of 11-mercapto-1-undecanol. The terminal hydroxy functionalities of derivative 2 were subsequently esterified with cinnamic acid (derivative 3), sulfatized with ClSO(3)H (derivative 4), or coupled with tert-butyldimethylsilyl-protected coumaric acid, to give, after deprotection with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (derivative 5) followed by sulfatization, p-(sulfooxy) cinnamic acid- (zosteric acid) labeled PHAE (derivative 6). The reactions proceeded with good yields and little side reactions, which was confirmed with (1)H NMR and GPC experiments. These functionalized polyesters are currently investigated as environmentally friendly coatings to protect surfaces from biofouling.
Development of ecotoxicity assay based on inhibition of respiring activity in microbial community using XTT reduction.	The aim of this study is to develop ecotoxicity assay for evaluating the influence of chemicals on a microbial ecosystem based on XTT reduction inhibition (XTT assay). XTT reduction method is used for quantification of the microbial respiratory activity. Since the XTT assay indicates the inhibition of microbial respiratory activity, it could evaluate the toxicity of chemicals. Suitable conditions for the XTT assay were determined to be 200 mg/L of particulate organic carbon as test microbe concentration and 15 min of assay time using activated sludge. Toxicities of several chemicals evaluated by activated sludge as test microbes were examined under these conditions. Sensitivity for the toxicity evaluated by the XTT assay using activated sludge microbes was almost the same value was that for the OECD activated sludge respiration inhibition test (ASRI test). XTT assay was also applied for evaluating the influence of chemicals on the soil microbial community and the XTT assay was used to evaluate a median effective concentration (EC(50)) value of 3,5-dichlorophenol (3,5-DCP). The EC(50) value of 3,5-DCP was almost the same as the value using activated sludge as test microbes. These results suggest that the XTT assay using both mixed cultures of non-contaminated environments and chemical extracts from various contaminated environments could evaluate the influence on microbial ecosystems affected by toxic chemicals.
Evaluation of different toxicity assays applied to proliferating cells and to stratified epithelium in relation to permeability enhancement with glycocholate.	The purpose of the present study was to evaluate different toxicity assays for use on proliferating buccal TR146 cells and on stratified TR146 epithelium and to compare these results to the permeability enhancing effect of glycocholate (GC). Both the proliferating cells and the epithelium were exposed to different GC concentrations for 4 h. The MTS/PMS assay and neutral red (NR) retention were performed along with quantitation of ATP, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and extracellular protein. The toxicity was calculated as the IC50 value relative to the control. Increase in 3H-mannitol permeability across the epithelium concurrent with a decrease in the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was also determined. The robustness of the epithelium was significantly higher than that of the proliferating cells (P <0.01). The ATP assay was the most sensitive assay with IC50 values of 6.4 and 11.5 mM for proliferating cells and epithelium, respectively. Intracellular LDH quantitation was the least sensitive method and extracellular LDH could not be used as a measure of toxicity partly due to interaction between LDH and GC. The effect on permeability and TEER could be correlated to the IC50 values obtained for the epithelium. The present study clearly demonstrates that for a correlation between toxicity and permeability enhancement, both studies should be performed on the epithelium.
Effect of calbindin-D28K on cyclosporine toxicity in cultured renal proximal tubular cells.	Cyclosporine A (CsA) is known to have direct toxicity to renal tubular cells. Its toxicity may be mediated by intracellular calcium because CsA increases intracellular calcium concentration and enhances the activities of calcium-dependent calpains and caspases. Calbindin-D28k, a cytosolic calcium binding protein, has been used as an intracellular Ca2+ buffer to reduce calcium-mediated cytotoxicity in non-renal cells such as neuronal cells. We investigated the effects of gene transfer of calbindin-D28k cDNA on CsA cytotoxicity and intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cultured murine proximal tubular (MCT) cells. A plasmid containing calbindin-D28k cDNA under the control of CMV promoter was transfected to MCT cells with liposomes. Cytotoxicity was assessed by LDH release and cell viability assay, and [Ca2+]i was measured ratiometrically with fura-2. Compared with MCT cells, cells transfected with calbindin-D28k cDNA showed a reduction in LDH release by 27, 30, 32, 33, and 19% (all P < 0.05), respectively, after 24 h exposure to 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 25 microM CsA. Cell viability after CsA treatment was also significantly higher in CB cells. A mock transfection using plasmid without calbindin-D28k cDNA insert did not affect the LDH release or cell viability after CsA treatment. CsA treatment did not affect the protein and mRNA abundance of transfected calbindin-D28k cDNA. The expression of calbindin-D28k did not affect the baseline [Ca2+]i, but significantly suppressed CsA-induced elevation in [Ca2+]i. The expression of calbindin-D28k in renal tubular cells provides cytoprotective effects against CsA toxicity, probably through its buffering effects on [Ca2+]i.
Observation of pathological morphology on nervous system of rat with maximum dose sophoridine in chronic toxic test]	Sophoridine is a new anticancer drug with noticeable antitumor action and lower toxicity. No marked influence on bone marrow was found till now. The main toxicity is presented in nervous system. This study was to observe the morphological changes of the nervous system of the rats, which were treated with maximum dose of sorphoridine for a long time.
The effect of temperature and NaCl concentration on the kinetic method of toxicity determination using Vibrio fischeri.	In this paper the effect of temperature and NaCl concentration on the kinetic method of toxicity determination using Vibrio fischeri was studied for 50 ppm Zn(2+). This work shows that both NaCl concentration and temperature affect the kinetics of toxicity as well as the luminescence of the bacteria, and hence these are important factors that need to be considered in the development of a miniaturised portable instrument. Furthermore, this work shows that the conditions for which the kinetic test was most sensitive, i.e. exhibited the greatest response, were 23 degrees C and 2% NaCl. However, at these conditions small variations in temperature and NaCl concentration could lead to great errors in the results. Thus 12.5 degrees C and 2% NaCl are preferred as at these conditions the obtained results are more robust. Although at the latter conditions the toxicity rate constant was found to be 5.5 times less than that for 23 degrees C, the value is comparable to that obtained for 15 degrees C. From the data available it was also found that the temperature dependence of the toxicity rate fits the Arrhenius equation, in a behaviour similar to that of simpler chemical reactions.
Neurotoxicity induced by antiepileptic drugs in cultured hippocampal neurons: a comparative study between carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and two new putative antiepileptic drugs, BIA 2-024 and BIA 2-093.	Newly designed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are being evaluated for their efficacy in preventing seizures and for their toxic profiles. We investigated and compared the toxic effects of two dibenz[b,f]azepine derivatives with anticonvulsant activity, 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxyimino-5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide (BIA2-024) and (S)-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,f] azepine-5-carboxamide (BIA2-093), with the structurally related compounds carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC), both in current use for the treatment of epilepsy.
Preliminary reliability and validity testing of a new Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool (STAT) in breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.	Clear consensus on the clinical evaluation of acute skin toxicity among cancer patients undergoing radical radiotherapy (RT) is currently lacking. This study investigates the reliability and validity of a new Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool (STAT) to evaluate the objective and subjective manifestations of RT-induced acute skin effects. The STAT was designed by a multidisciplinary team involved in the management of radiation skin reactions. The tool has 3 components: patient and treatment parameters, observer scoring, and patient-reported symptoms, and was piloted in a cohort of 27 breast cancer patients by pairs of independent blinded observers. Each patient was assessed weekly during RT and 2 weeks after therapy completion. Validity and reliability testing of the STAT was performed. Information on the tool's ease of use was obtained by recording the time necessary to complete the assessment at each visit and by a survey among the tool's users. All subjects developed some degree of skin reaction during breast RT. The level of agreement between observers in eliciting subjective complaints ranged from 72% to 92% (95% CI = 63-96%; kappa = 0.33-0.68). The interobserver agreement in scoring skin reactions ranged from 65.0 to 97.5% (kappa = 0.46-0.81). Objective and subjective toxicity scores were significantly correlated (P < 0.05). The STAT was easy to use and required on average a few minutes to complete at each visit. The STAT is an easy-to-use, standardized instrument to evaluate acute skin reaction and may be applied to clinical care and research in patients undergoing radiotherapy.
Synergistic embryotoxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists with cytochrome P4501A inhibitors in Fundulus heteroclitus.	Widespread contamination of aquatic systems with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has led to concern about effects of PAHs on aquatic life. Some PAHs have been shown to cause deformities in early life stages of fish that resemble those elicited by planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (pHAHs) that are agonists for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Previous studies have suggested that activity of cytochrome P4501A, a member of the AHR gene battery, is important to the toxicity of pHAHs, and inhibition of CYP1A can reduce the early-life-stage toxicity of pHAHs. In light of the effects of CYP1A inhibition on pHAH-derived toxicity, we explored the impact of both model and environmentally relevant CYP1A inhibitors on PAH-derived embryotoxicity. We exposed Fundulus heteroclitus embryos to two PAH-type AHR agonists, ss-naphthoflavone and benzo(a)pyrene, and one pHAH-type AHR agonist, 3,3 ,4,4 ,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126), alone and in combination with several CYP1A inhibitors. In agreement with previous studies, coexposure of embryos to PCB-126 with the AHR antagonist and CYP1A inhibitor alpha-naphthoflavone decreased frequency and severity of deformities compared with embryos exposed to PCB-126 alone. In contrast, embryos coexposed to the PAHs with each of the CYP1A inhibitors tested were deformed with increased severity and frequency compared with embryos dosed with PAH alone. The mechanism by which inhibition of CYP1A increased embryotoxicity of the PAHs tested is not understood, but these results may be helpful in elucidating mechanisms by which PAHs are embryotoxic. Additionally, these results call into question additive models of PAH embryotoxicity for environmental PAH mixtures that contain both AHR agonists and CYP1A inhibitors.
Bioavailability and chronic toxicity of zinc to juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss): comparison with other fish species and development of a biotic ligand model.	In this study, the effects of modifying Ca (0.2-4 mM), Mg (0.05-3 mM), Na (0.75-5 mM), and pH (5.5-7.5) on the chronic toxicity of zinc to juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were investigated using standard 30-d assays in which survival and growth were monitored. Survival was observed to be a more sensitive end point than growth, and mortality mainly occurred during the initial stages of the exposure. This suggested that the mode of action of zinc toxicity was mainly of an acute nature. A review and analysis of existing literature demonstrated similar results for most other fish species investigated. Overall, up to a 30-fold variation of zinc toxicity was observed, as indicated by no observed effect concentrations varying between 32.7 and 974 microg of Zn L(-1). Increased concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and H+ (within the tested ranges) resulted in a reduction of chronic zinc toxicity by a factor of 12, 3, >2, and 2, respectively. This suggests the major importance of Ca competing with zinc and protecting against zinc toxicity, which seems to be a ubiquitous concept in fish species (and probably also invertebrate). On the basis of the toxicity data obtained, a chronic biotic ligand model (BLM) was developed that takes into account both chemical speciation of zinc and competition between zinc and the above-mentioned cations. The developed model was able to predict chronic effect concentrations with an error of less than a factor of 2 in most cases. Hence, it was concluded that the chronic Zn BLM can reduce toxicity variability due to bioavailability to a considerable extent and that the BLM can become an important tool in criteria setting and risk assessment practice of zinc and zinc substances.
Effects of sediment characteristics on the toxicity of chromium(III) and chromium(VI) to the amphipod, Hyalella azteca.	We evaluated the influence of sediment characteristics, acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) and organic matter (OM), on the toxicity of chromium (Cr) in freshwater sediments. We conducted chronic (28-42-d) toxicitytests with the amphipod Hyalella azteca exposed to Cr(VI) and Cr(III) in water and in spiked sediments. Waterborne Cr(VI) caused reduced survival of amphipods with a median lethal concentration (LC50) of 40 microg/L. Cr(VI) spiked into test sediments with differing levels of AVS resulted in graded decreases in AVS and sediment OM. Only Cr(VI)-spiked sediments with low AVS concentrations (< 1micromol/g) caused significant amphipod mortality. Waterborne Cr(III) concentrations near solubility limits caused decreased survival of amphipods at pH 7 and pH 8 but not at pH 6. Sediments spiked with high levels of Cr(III) did not affect amphipod survival but had minor effects on growth and inconsistent effects on reproduction. Pore waters of some Cr(III)-spiked sediments contained measurable concentrations of Cr(VI), but observed toxic effects did not correspond closely to Cr concentrations in sediment or pore waters. Our results indicate that risks of Cr toxicity are low in freshwater sediments containing substantial concentrations of AVS.
Method for testing the aquatic toxicity of sediment extracts for use in identifying organic toxicants in sediments.	Biologically directed fractionation techniques are a fundamental tool for identifying the cause of toxicity in environmental samples, but few are available for studying mixtures of organic chemicals in aquatic sediments. This paper describes a method for extracting organic chemicals from sediments and then re-introducing them into water column toxicity tests in a way that mimics, at least in part, the partitioning processes that govern bioavailability in sediment. This involves transferring solvent extracts of sediment into triolein and then placing the mixture inside low-density polyethylene dialysis tubing in a configuration similar to semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) used for environmental monitoring. For four model compounds, SPMDs were shown to effectively maintain water column exposure in static systems for 10-14 d, with partition coefficients similar to K(OW). Toxicity tests indicated that the SPMDs were compatible with four of five freshwater organisms tested and could be used to measure both lethal and sublethal end points. An example application showed good correspondence between organism responses in intactsediment and extracts in SPMDsfor both field-collected and spiked sediments. The SPMD-based method offers a simple, flexible test design, amenable to several different test organisms, and the ability to work with complex mixtures of contaminants while maintaining partitioning behavior similar to that within intact sediments.
Toward more useful in vitro toxicity data with measured free concentrations.	In vitro assays and computer models are promising alternatives for in vivo animal testing, but the power of these alternative methods to predict in vivo risk is still very limited. One step forward is to make the outcome of in vitro assays (such as median effect concentrations (EC50 values)) independent of assay conditions such as protein content. Here we show that measured free concentrations of chemicals in the in vitro assay medium result in system-independent EC50 values. We introduce a very simple method to measure free concentrations in miniature test systems using negligible depletion solid-phase microextraction. The generated data are much more suitable for extrapolation to in vivo, provide unbiased input for computational methods (for example, quantitative structure-activity relationships), and can shed an entirely different light on the activity of environmental contaminants.
Population consequences of fipronil and degradates to copepods at field concentrations: an integration of life cycle testing with leslie matrix population modeling.	The predominant data used in ecological risk assessment today are individual-based rather than population-based; yet environmental policies are usually designed to protect populations of threatened species or communities. Most current methods in ecotoxicology are limited by largely logistic/ technology-driven requirements that yield data for a relatively small number of test species and end points that focus on acute lethality or sublethal nonproduction-based parameters (e.g., biomarkers, mutagenesis, genetic change, physiological condition). A contrasting example is presented here showing the predictive ability of meiobenthos-based full life cycle toxicity testing to extrapolate multi-generational effects of chemicals on variables of import to population growth and maintenance. Less than 24-h-old larvae of a meiobenthic copepod were reared individually in 96-well microplate exposures to parent and degradates of the phenylpyrazole insecticide fipronil. Survival, development rates, sex ratio change, fertility, fecundity, and hatching success were tracked daily for 32 d through mating and production of three broods in spiked seawater. These data were then inserted in a Leslie (Lefkovitch) matrix stage-based population growth model to predict relative rates of population increase (lambda) and changes in net population growth with time and toxicant concentration. Field-reported test concentrations produced strong reproductive (52-88%) and net production (40-80%) depressions for parent (at 0.25 and 0.5 microg/L), desthionyl (0.25 and 0.5 microg/L), and sulfide (0.15 microg/L) moieties as compared to controls. Spiked sediment exposures of 65-300 ng of fipronil/g of dry sediment yielded significantly reduced production rates per female that were 67-50% of control production. The consistent reproductively linked impacts of fipronil and its degradation products at the population maintenance levels suggest risks to sediment-dwelling crustaceans at concentrations well below noneffects for most aquatic test species based on risk assessment data from primarily acute and sub-life cycle toxicity tests.
Cytotoxic effects of novel polyoxotungstates and a platinum compound on human cancer cell lines.	The cytotoxicity of a new platinum compound Pt1 [2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthrolinedichloroplatin(II)] and six polyoxometalates (POM1-6) on two neuroblastoma cell lines (SHEP-SF and KCN) and an Ewing's Sarcoma cell line (CADO-ES-1) was studied. Cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)] and carboplatin [cis-diammine(cyclobutanedicarboxylato)platinum(II)] were used as reference agents. Using MTT tests, the cytotoxicity (LD50: lethal doses 50%) of the compounds were measured at different concentrations. After 72 h exposure, the LD50 data for the platinum-containing substances ranged between 4.47 x 10(-6) and 1.91 x 10(-4) M. The SHEP-SF cell line displayed the highest sensitivity to cisplatin. The novel platinum agent Pt1 had a similar cytotoxic effect to the reference agent cisplatin. Both cisplatin and Pt1 were more cytotoxic than carboplatin. The POMs reduced cell viability compared to untreated cells at concentrations between 8.4 x 10(-7) and 3.47 x 10(-5) M. POM1 ([(CH3)4N]2Na6.5(NH4)2[SnII1.5(WO2(OH))0.5(WO2)2(SbW9O33)2] x 32H2O) was the most effective polyoxoanion with a mean LD50 value of 8.83 x 10(-6) M in the three cell lines tested. With CADO-ES-1 and KCN cells, POM1 was found to be more effective than the platinum compounds cisplatin, carboplatin and Pt1.
Glucosamine effects in humans: a review of effects on glucose metabolism, side effects, safety considerations and efficacy.	Glucosamine is widely used to relieve symptoms from osteoarthritis. Its safety and effects on glucose metabolism are critically evaluated in this review. The LD50 of oral glucosamine in animals is approximately 8000 mg/kg with no adverse effects at 2700 mg/kg for 12 months. Because altered glucose metabolism can be associated with parenteral administration of large doses of glucosamine in animals and with high concentrations in in vitro studies, we critically evaluated the clinical importance of these effects. Oral administration of large doses of glucosamine in animals has no documented effects on glucose metabolism. In vitro studies demonstrating effects of glucosamine on glucose metabolism have used concentrations that are 100-200 times higher than tissue levels expected with oral glucosamine administration in humans. We reviewed clinical trial data for 3063 human subjects. Fasting plasma glucose values decreased slightly for subjects after oral glucosamine for approximately 66 weeks. There were no adverse effects of oral glucosamine administration on blood, urine or fecal parameters. Side effects were significantly less common with glucosamine than placebo or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). In contrast to NSAID, no serious or fatal side effects have been reported for glucosamine. Our critical evaluation indicates that glucosamine is safe under current conditions of use and does not affect glucose metabolism.
Synthesis and biological properties of new stilbene derivatives of resveratrol as new selective aryl hydrocarbon modulators.	We developed new stilbene derivatives of resveratrol (E)-1-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)ethene) selective for AhR and devoid of affinity for ER. Among the 24 stilbenes synthesized, all display a higher affinity than resveratrol for AhR. (E)-1-(4'-Trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-(3,5-ditrifluoromethylphenyl)ethene (4e), (E)-1-(4'-methoxyphenyl)-2-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)ethene (4j), and (E)-1-(4'-chlorophenyl)-2-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)ethene (4b) are selective, high-affinity AhR antagonists with, respective, K(i)s of 2.1, 1.4, and 1.2 nM. (E)-1-(4'-Trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)ethene (4i) displays a K(i) of 0.2 nM and is a selective and high-affinity agonist on AhR.
Cultured gill epithelial cells from tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus): a new in vitro assay for toxicants.	A culture gill epithelium from seawater-adapted tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was developed for testing PAHs and dioxin-like contaminants in seawater. The epithelia consists two to three layers of epithelial cells incorporating both pavement cells and mitochondria-rich cells (MRCs). Polarity and a stable transepithelial resistance (TER) were maintained, and closely resembled those in fish gills in vivo. The tightness (integrity) of the epithelia remained unchanged upon exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB#126), while a concentration-dependent response of EROD activity in the epithelia was induced within 18-24 h when the apical side was exposed to these toxicants. The 24 h EC50 of EROD activity was 2.77x10(-7) M for PCB#126, 1.85x10(-7) M for B[a]P and 7.38x10(-10) M for TCDD, showing that the preparation was not only sensitive to PAHs and dioxin-like compounds, but also able to produce inductive potency of AhR agonists that generally agreed with those derived from other established in vitro and in vivo systems. The results suggest that the cultured gill epithelia from seawater-adapted tilapia may serve as a simple, rapid and cost-effective tool for assessing exposure and potential effects of toxicants in marine waters.
Estradiol and endocrine disrupting compounds adversely affect development of sea urchin embryos at environmentally relevant concentrations.	Environmental endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are a wide variety of chemicals that typically exert effects, either directly or indirectly, through receptor-mediated processes, thus mimicking endogenous hormones and/or inhibiting normal hormone activities and metabolism. Little is known about the effects of EDCs on echinoderm physiology, reproduction and development. We exposed developing sea urchin embryos (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Lytechinus anamesus) to two known EDCs (4-octylphenol (OCT), bisphenol A (BisA)) and to natural and synthetic reproductive hormones (17beta-estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), estriol (E3), progesterone (P4) and 17alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2)). In addition, we studied two non-estrogenic EDCs, tributyltin (TBT) and o,p-DDD. Successful development to the pluteus larval stage (96 h post-fertilization) was used to define EDC concentration-response relationships. The order of compound potency based on EC50 values for a reduction in normal development was as follows: TBT(L. anamesus)>OCT>TBT(S. purpuratus)>>E2>EE2>DDD>>BisA>P4>E1>>E3. The effect of TBT was pronounced even at concentrations substantially lower than those commonly reported in heavily contaminated areas, but the response was significantly different in the two model species. Sea urchin embryos were generally more sensitive to estrogenic EDCs and TBT than most other invertebrate larvae. Stage-specific exposure experiments were conducted to determine the most sensitive developmental periods using blastula, gastrula and post-gastrula (pluteus) stages. The stage most sensitive to E2, OCT and TBT was the blastula stage with less overall sensitivity in the gastrula stage, regardless of concentration. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) were added to the experiments individually and in combination with estrogenic EDCs to interfere with potential receptor-mediated actions. Tamoxifen, a partial ER agonist, alone inhibited development at concentrations as low as 0.02 ng/ml and was effective at this concentration in decreasing the sensitivities of the embryos to estradiol and estrogenic EDCs. The complete antagonist ICI 182,780 inhibited development at concentrations as low as 0.03 ng/ml but increased embryo sensitivity to estradiol and estrogenic EDCs. Estradiol and estrogenic EDCs all cause developmental toxicity in sea urchins through a TAM-sensitive but an ICI-insensitive mechanism. It remains to be demonstrated whether this mechanism involves an estrogen-responsive nuclear receptor (NR), a membrane receptor (NR or non-NR-related) or a completely different mechanism of toxicity. However, early embryo sensitivity and the differential response to SERM co-incubation further suggests more than one mode of EDC action in the developing sea urchin embryo.
Ecotoxicological evaluation of the additive butylated hydroxyanisole using a battery with six model systems and eighteen endpoints.	The occurrence and fate of additives in the aquatic environment is an emerging issue in environmental chemistry. This paper describes the ecotoxicological effects of the commonly used additive butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) using a test battery, comprising of several different organisms and in vitro test systems, representing a proportion of the different trophic levels. The most sensitive system to BHA was the inhibition of bioluminescence in Vibrio fischeri bacteria, which resulted in an acute low observed adverse effect concentration (LOAEC) of 0.28 microM. The next most sensitive system was the immobilization of the cladoceran Daphnia magna followed by: the inhibition of the growth of the unicellular alga Chlorella vulgaris; the endpoints evaluated in Vero (mammalian) cells (total protein content, LDH activity, neutral red uptake and MTT metabolization), mitotic index and root growth inhibition in the terrestrial plant Allium cepa, and finally, the endpoints used on the RTG-2 salmonid fish cell line (neutral red uptake, total protein content, MTS metabolization, lactate dehydrogenase leakage and activity, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity). Morphological alterations in RTG-2 cells were also assessed and these included loss of cells, induction of cellular pleomorphism, hydropic degeneration and induction of apoptosis at high concentrations. The results from this study also indicated that micronuclei were not induced in A.cepa exposed to BHA. The differences in sensitivity for the diverse systems that were used (EC50 ranged from 1.2 to >500 microM) suggest the importance for a test battery approach in the evaluation of the ecological consequences of chemicals. According to the results, the levels of BHA reported in industrial wastewater would elicit adverse effects in the environment. This, coupled with its potential to bioaccumulate, makes BHA a pollutant of concern not only for acute exposures, but also for the long-term.
In vitro embryotoxicity assessment with dental restorative materials.	Resin (co)monomers may be released from restorative dental materials and can diffuse into the tooth pulp or the gingiva, and can reach the saliva and the circulating blood. Genotoxic potential of some dental composite components has been clearly documented. The genotoxic effects of xenobiotics can represent a possible step in tumor initiation and/or embryotoxicity/teratogenesis. A modified fluorescent mouse embryonic stem cell test (R.E.Tox) was used to test the embryotoxic potential of following dental restorative materials: Bisphenol A glycidylmethacrylate (BisGMA), urethanedimethacrylate (UDMA), hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA), and triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate (TEGDMA), as well as some of their metabolic intermediates 2,3-epoxy-2-methyl-propionicacid-methylester (EMPME), methacrylic acid (MA), and 2,3-epoxy-2-methylpropionic acid (EMPA).
Genotoxicity and cytotoxicity assay of water sampled from the underground nuclear explosion site in the north of the Perm region (Russia).	The results of our study revealed a local biologically relevant surface water contamination in the radionuclide anomaly in the north of Russia (Perm region) by means of Allium schoenoprasum L. anaphase-telophase chromosome aberration assay. This radionuclide anomaly was formed in 1971 as a result of an underground nuclear explosion with soil excavation. Specific activities of main dose-forming radionuclides in all examined reservoirs are below intervention levels officially adopted in Russia for drinking water. We found that (90)Sr significantly contributes to induction of cytogenetic disturbances. Our previous data and the data described here suggest that metal and radionuclide combined exposure (with the dose below permissible exposure limits for human) may cause substantial biological effects. These effects are in part due to synergic response. The findings described here indicated that development of a new concept of radiation protection for humans and biota should be based on the clear understanding of biological effects of low doses of radiation in chronic exposure to multi-pollutant mixtures.
Transfection activity of polyamidoamine dendrimers having hydrophobic amino acid residues in the periphery.	We designed poly(amidoamine) dendrimers with phenylalanine or leucine residues at their chain ends. Thereby, we achieved efficient gene transfection of cells through synergy of the proton sponge effect, which is induced by the internal tertiary amines of the dendrimer, and hydrophobic interaction by the hydrophobic amino acid residues in the dendrimer periphery. Dendrimers having 16, 29, 46, and 64 terminal phenylalanine residues were prepared by the reaction of the amine-terminated poly(amidoamine) G4 dendrimer and L-phenylalanine using condensing reagent 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Transfection activity of these phenylalanine-modified dendrimers for CV1 cells, an African green monkey kidney cell line, increased concomitant with the increasing number of the terminal phenylalanine residues, except for the dendrimer with 64 phenylalanine residues, which showed poor water solubility and hardly formed a complex with DNA at neutral pH. However, under weakly acidic conditions, the dendrimer with 64 phenylalanine residues formed a complex with DNA, thereby achieving highly efficient transfection. In contrast, the attachment of L-leucine residues was unable to improve the transfection activity of the parent dendrimer, probably because of the relatively lower hydrophobicity of this amino acid. The phenylalanine-modified dendrimer exhibited a higher transfection activity and a lower cytotoxicity than some widely used transfection reagents. For that reason, the phenylalanine-modified dendrimers are considered to be promising gene carriers.
Copoly(styrene-maleic acid)-pirarubicin micelles: high tumor-targeting efficiency with little toxicity.	The copolymer of styrene-maleic acid (SMA) was used to construct micelles containing pirarubicin (4'-O-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin, or THP) as a new anticancer drug formulation. The procedure for the preparation of the micelles was simple, the component consisting of only SMA and pirarubicin in a noncovalent association, possibly by hydrophobic interaction between the styrene portion of SMA and pirarubicin chromophore. This method ensures more than 80% recovery of pirarubicin by weight, and 60% of drug loading (by weight) was achieved. The micelles obtained (SMA-THP) showed high solubility in water and a constant pirarubicin release rate of about 3-4%/day in vitro. SMA-THP micelles had an average molecular size of about 34 kDa according to gel chromatography; this size is a marked increase from the 627.6 Da of free THP, which suggests the formation of a micellar structure. When albumin was added, the molecular size of the micelles increased to about 94 kDa, which indicates binding to albumin, a unique characteristic of SMA. SMA-THP micelle preparation had a cytotoxic effect (93-101%) on MCF-7 breast cancer cells and SW480 human colon cancer cells in vitro that was comparable to that of free THP. An in vivo assay of SMA-THP at doses of 20 mg/kg in ddY mice bearing S-180 tumor revealed complete tumor eradication in 100% of tested animals. Mice survived for more than 1 year after treatment with micellar drug doses as high as 100 mg/kg pirarubicin equivalent. This marked antitumor activity can be attributed to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of macromolecular drugs seen in solid tumors, which enables selective delivery of drugs to tumor and thus much fewer side effects. Complete blood counts, liver function test, and cardiac histology showed no sign of adverse effects for intravenous doses of the micellar preparation. These data thus suggest that intravenous administration of the SMA-THP micellar formulation can enhance the therapeutic effect of pirarubicin more than 50-fold.
Extent of sonochemical degradation and change of toxicity of a pharmaceutical precursor (triphenylphosphine oxide) in water as a function of treatment conditions.	The degradation of triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) in water, a toxic compound typically found in effluents from the pharmaceutical industry, by means of ultrasonic irradiation at 20 kHz has been investigated with emphasis on the effect of various parameters on conversion and acute toxicity. Experiments were carried out at liquid volumes of 50 and 80 ml, electric power outputs of 125, 187.5 and 250 W, initial TPPO concentrations of 10, 100 and 350 mg/L and temperatures of 5, 20, 35, 50 and 70 degrees C. TPPO conversion was found to increase with increasing power output and decreasing initial concentration and temperature. Measurements of dissolved total carbon showed that liquid-phase degradation by-products were more stable to ultrasonic irradiation than TPPO. Addition of t-butanol as a radical scavenger at a concentration of 1000 mg/L nearly completely suppressed TPPO degradation. Conversely, addition of radical promoters (Fe(2+) ions or H(2)O(2)) had a positive effect on degradation. Acute toxicity to marine bacteria vibrio fischeri was measured before and after ultrasonic irradiation. At the conditions employed in this study, irradiated TPPO samples were always more toxic than TPPO itself with toxicity levels being a function of treatment conditions.
Measuring the antioxidant activity of olive oil mill wastewater using chemiluminescence.	A sensitive and simple procedure is described for determining the total phenolic/antioxidant levels of olive oil mill wastewater (OMW), using for the first time Co(II)/ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA)-induced luminol chemiluminescence. Olive oil wastewater samples were tested for their composition in simple phenolic compounds as a function of the extraction system (two- and three-phase centrifugation systems). The results revealed that the three-phase system had a stronger antioxidant activity and a higher total phenolic content than the two-phase system. The relationship between antioxidant values and total phenolic content is also discussed.
Effect of Nannochloris sp. on the toxicity of four algae.	The effect of Nannochloris sp. on the toxicity of cultures of four algae was evaluated using a Microtox 500 that measures the effect on a light-producing bacterium, Vibrio fischeri. Cultures of four algae produced a toxic effect, but in the presence of Nannochloris sp., the effect was reversed, and a stimulatory effect was observed. The effect was tested for Microcystis aeroginosa, Cyclotella menengheniana, Scenedesmus dimorphis, and Lyngbya sp. using cultures obtained from the University of Texas Culture Collection of Algae.
Effects of butylated hydroxyanisole on the development and functions of reproductive system in rats.	Butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA) is a widely used antioxidant for long preservation of food products, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Although BHA is generally recognized as safe, it is classified as a suspected endocrine-disrupting compound. We investigated the effects of BHA on reproductive function and development by the treatment of mature male and female SD rats (F0) through pre-gestation, gestation and lactation period and of their offspring (F1) until 13 weeks old via gavage with BHA 0 (corn oil, vehicle control), 10, 100 and 500 mg/kg bw/day. Organ weights of liver, adrenal gland and thyroid gland of F0 rats were increased by BHA 500 mg/kg but those of spleen and ventral prostate were decreased without significant difference in terminal body weight. Reduced serum testosterone and thyroxine (T4) were observed with dose-dependent manner in F0 male rats. Mating rate was decreased and cohabitation duration for conception was longer without differences in the number, motility and morphology of sperm by BHA 500 mg/kg. Body weight of F1 offspring was significantly decreased with change of relative weight of liver and brain by BHA 500 mg/kg at PND21. Sexual maturation indicated by vaginal opening and preputial separation was delayed by BHA 500 mg/kg. The weights of liver and adrenal gland were increased while those of spleen, vagina, testes and ventral prostate were decreased in F1 rats exposed to BHA 100 or 500 mg/kg for 13 weeks. Also, BHA 500 mg/kg reduced the velocity of sperm motion and number with smaller-sized sperm head in F1 male rats and slightly shortened estrous cycle length with higher frequency of estrus and lower frequency of diestrus stages in F1 female rats. Lower serum T4 and testosterone contents with higher serum cholesterol levels were also observed by BHA 500 mg/kg. Increased follicular cell height, and exfoliated and vacuolated follicular epithelial cells were observed in thyroids of F1 female and males rats exposed to BHA 500 mg/kg. This study elucidates that high dose of BHA induce weak dysfunction and underdevelopment of reproductive system of male and female rats with the change of T4 and testosterone levels, sex organ weights and sexual maturation and histological lesions of thyroid gland.
Regional comparisons of coastal sediment contamination detected by a biomarker (P450 HRGS; EPA Method 4425).	Pollution investigations by the Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have been conducted since 1984 and have incorporated extensive biological and chemical analyses. Since 1993, one of the biological tests utilized in these studies has been the biomarker P450HRGS, which is more recently described as EPA Method 4425. Extracts of sediments are applied to a human cell line with a reporter gene (firefly luciferase) at the CYP1A1 site. Light produced by the extracts is a function of the concentrations and potencies of those compounds with an affinity for Ah-receptor (certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dioxins/ furans). These compounds are carcinogenic and can produce chronic toxicity, and those containing chlorine are persistent and bioaccumulated. Nineteen coastal regions and 1309 samples from the three U.S. coasts have been evaluated as part of the NOAA investigations. The stratified random sampling approach used by NOAA provides estimates of the areas (km2) of each region containing levels of the compounds above thresholds. From analysis of the database, sediments with concentrations at or below 11 microg benzo[a]pyrene equivalents (B[a]PEq)/g would not be expected to produce effects on the benthos. At 32 microg B[a]PEq/g and above there is the potential for impacts on the biota, and above 60 microg/g, the degradation of the benthic community has been observed. Several of the regional surveys found no samples at or above 60 microg B[a]PEq/g, but 60% of the samples from New York Harbor (280 km2) were above this level. Analyses of data from Puget Sound and Chesapeake Bay demonstrate an increase in samples above 32 microg B[a]PEq/g in more populated and industrial regions. Method 4425 serves as both a biomarker, simulating the response of an organism (with CYP1A) exposed to inducing compounds, and as a bioanalytical technique measuring the levels of these chemicals in the samples. A targeted investigation of the distribution of the three important classes of compounds identified by Method 4425 would be more cost-effective by first screening samples by this method before expending substantial funds in the detailed chemical analysis of all samples.
The use of Microtox to assess toxicity removal of industrial effluents from the industrial district of Camaçari (BA, Brazil).	The treatment efficiency, as toxicity removal, of complex effluents from the Industrial District of Camaçari (BA, Brazil), after biological treatment with activated sludge was evaluated using Microtox. Samples of the equalised effluent (EE) were collected prior to treatment together with samples of the treated effluent (TE), which remained 24 h in the treatment plant. Rehydrated colonies of Vibrio fischeri were exposed to sequential dilutions of EE and TE to assess luminosity interference. Values for EC50 were calculated, together with the respective toxicity units. In all, twenty assays of each effluent type were carried out and the mean toxicity removal was 92.71%, while the chemical oxygen demand (COD) presented mean reduction of 83.04%. There was a variability of an order of magnitude between the Microtox results for the two types of effluents. The mean EC50 values were 2.12 for EE and 47.78% for TE. In spite of its weakness in some conditions, the Microtox system demonstrated to work adequately in assessing effluent toxicity removal in this treatment plant and therefore can be used for further toxicity removal programs.
Influence of hydroxypropylcyclodextrins on the toxicity of mixtures.	We studied the influence of hydroxypropylcyclodextrins (HPCDs) on the toxicity of some mixtures. Using the Photobacterium phosphoreum toxicity test, the joint toxicological effect for Mixture I (containing p-nitrobenzaldehyde and 1-nitronaphthalene) and Mixture II (containing p-nitrobenzaldehyde and malononitrile) were determined in water and in aqueous solutions of HPCDs. The results indicate that, although the toxicological joint effect for Mixture I (simple addition) differs from that of Mixture II (synergism), alpha- and beta-HPCD can significantly reduce the toxicity of the test compounds, whereas gamma-HPCD has only a slight effect. Explanations for these observations are given that invoke the molecular structure of the individual chemicals as well as the structures of HPCDs. This provides information to assist the application of HPCDs in remediation of environmental pollution.
Functional relationships among selenium concentrations in the diet, target tissues, and nondestructive tissue samples of two species of snakes.	Nondestructive sampling methods, such as removal of feathers for contaminant analysis, are desirable in ecological monitoring programs that seek to minimize the impacts of harvesting organisms. Although many reptiles are declining worldwide, nondestructive sampling techniques seldom have been employed for assessing contaminant exposure in these organisms. In this study, we examined the utility of nondestructive tissue sampling for assessing Se exposure in reptiles. We describe the functional relationships among dietary Se concentrations, target tissue Se concentrations, and Se concentrations in nondestructive tissue samples (blood and tail tissue biopsy) in two species of snakes that had been exposed to Se under very different experimental protocols. Using nonlinear regression, we found strong positive correlations (r2 > 0.92) in all comparisons among Se concentrations in nondestructive tissues, diet, and target tissues. Moreover, equations describing these relationships can be used to estimate concentrations of Se in diet and target organs, from known concentrations of Se in nondestructive tissue samples. Although the current paucity of toxicity data on reptiles precludes tests of our models, we demonstrate how the equations describing these relationships might be used to make predictions about Se accumulation in target organs for risk assessment. Future studies on reptiles that examine these relationships under different Se exposure conditions, and those that document physiological responses of reptiles to various concentrations of Se, will help to refine our models and test their efficacy for predicting health risk.
Effect of toxic cations on copper rhizotoxicity in wheat seedlings.	Copper pollution may occur in acidic soils where the low pH leads to release of Al and Mn in soil solution, which could interact with Cu toxicity. Very little information exists regarding the influence of toxic cations on the phytotoxicity of Cu. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that phytotoxicity of Cu2+ may be overestimated in acidic soils due to synergism between Al or Mn and Cu toxicity. Rhizotoxicity of Al, Mn, and Cu to wheat seedlings was studied in well-defined nutrient solutions, with these elements present singly or in combination. Toxicity was expressed on a solution metal-activity basis, with metal activities calculated using GEOCHEM-PC and verified using Donnan dialysis. Of the three ions, Cu2+ was the most rhizotoxic, with activities of Cu2+, Al3+, and Mn2+ resulting in a 25% reduction in root elongation of 0.12, 1.26, and 211 microM, respectively. Although there was no interaction between Mn2+ and Cu2+ toxicity, Cu2+ was significantly less toxic on a relative basis in the presence of Al3+. Thus, critical thresholds for soil solution Cu2+ activity determined in acidic soils will be underprotective compared to soils that contain low concentrations of soluble Al (e.g., limed or nonacidic soils).
Insecticide species sensitivity distributions: importance of test species selection and relevance to aquatic ecosystems.	Single-species acute toxicity data and (micro)mesocosm data were collated for 16 insecticides. These data were used to investigate the importance of test-species selection in constructing species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) and the ability of estimated hazardous concentrations (HCs) to protect freshwater aquatic ecosystems. A log-normal model was fitted to a minimum of six data points, and the resulting distribution was used to estimate lower (95% confidence), median (50% confidence), and upper (5% confidence) 5% HC (HC5) values. Species sensitivity distributions for specific taxonomic groups (vertebrates, arthropods, nonarthropod invertebrates), habitats (saltwater, freshwater, lentic, lotic), and geographical regions (Palaearctic, Nearctic, temperate, tropical) were compared. The taxonomic composition of the species assemblage used to construct the SSD does have a significant influence on the assessment of hazard, but the habitat and geographical distribution of the species do not. Moreover, SSDs constructed using species recommended in test guidelines did not differ significantly from those constructed using nonrecommended species. Hazardous concentrations estimated using laboratory-derived acute toxicity data for freshwater arthropods (i.e., the most sensitive taxonomic group) were compared to the response of freshwater ecosystems exposed to insecticides. The sensitivity distributions of freshwater arthropods were similar for both field and laboratory exposure, and the lower HC5 (95% protection with 95% confidence) estimate was protective of adverse ecological effects in freshwater ecosystems. The corresponding median HC5 (95% protection level with 50% confidence) was generally protective of single applications of insecticide but not of continuous or multiple applications. In the latter cases, a safety factor of at least five should be applied to the median HC5.
Use of laboratory toxicity tests with bivalve and echinoderm embryos to evaluate the bioavailability of copper in San Diego Bay, California, USA.	Copper concentrations in parts of San Diego Bay (CA, USA) exceed ambient water quality criteria (WQC; currently 3.1 microg/L dissolved, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [U.S. EPA]). In order to better understand the bioavailability of copper to water-column organisms in the bay, toxicity tests were performed with copper added to surface water collected from various sites in the estuary over a three-year period. The species and endpoints used, bivalve and echinoderm embryo-larval development, are among the most sensitive in the U.S. EPA's national toxicity dataset, which is used to derive WQC. No toxicity was observed in ambient bay water samples, as indicated by high proportions of normally developed larvae in control treatments, averaging 93+/-5% across all sites and all sampling events. Median effects concentrations (EC50), obtained by copper spiking of ambient water samples, ranged from 1.7 to 3.4 times lower at sites located near the mouth compared to sites near the back of the bay. These data indicate a gradient in complexation capacity increasing from the mouth to the back of the bay, which is consistent with similar trends in dissolved organic carbon and total suspended solids. For the bay as a whole, estimates for total recoverable and dissolved water-effect ratios (WER) ranged from 2.07 to 2.27 and 1.54 to 1.67, respectively. Water-effect ratios of this magnitude suggest that adoption of a somewhat higher site-specific WQC for San Diego Bay still would achieve the level of protection that is intended by the WQC guidelines.
Toxicity of fluoroquinolone antibiotics to aquatic organisms.	Toxicity tests were performed with seven fluoroquinolone antibiotics, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, clinafloxacin, enrofloxacin, and flumequine, on five aquatic organisms. Overall toxicity values ranged from 7.9 to 23,000 microg/L. The cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa was the most sensitive organism (5-d growth and reproduction, effective concentrations [EC50s] ranging from 7.9 to 1,960 microg/L and a median of 49 microg/L), followed by duckweed (Lemna minor, 7-d reproduction, EC50 values ranged from 53 to 2,470 microg/L with a median of 106 microg/L) and the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (3-d growth and reproduction, EC50 values ranged from 1,100 to 22,700 microg/L with a median 7,400 microg/L). Results from tests with the crustacean Daphnia magna (48-h survival) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas, 7-d early life stage survival and growth) showed limited toxicity with no-observed-effect concentrations at or near 10 mg/L. Fish dry weights obtained in the ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and ofloxacin treatments (10 mg/L) were significantly higher than in control fish. The hazard of adverse effects occurring to the tested organisms in the environment was quantified by using hazard quotients. An estimated environmental concentration of 1 microg/L was chosen based on measured environmental concentrations previously reported in surface water; at this level, only M. aeruginosa may be at risk in surface water. However, the selective toxicity of these compounds may have implications for aquatic community structure.
Structure-toxicity relationships for the effects to Tetrahymena pyriformis of aliphatic, carbonyl-containing, alpha,beta-unsaturated chemicals.	Toxicity data for 82 aliphatic chemicals with an alpha,beta-unsaturated substructure were compiled. Toxicity was assessed in the 2-day Tetrahymena pyriformis population growth impairment assay. Toxic potency [log(IGC50(-1))] for most of these chemicals was in excess of baseline narcosis as quantified by the 1-octanol/water partition coefficient (log K(ow)). The toxicity of the alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes was modeled well by log K(ow) in conjunction with the sum of partial charges on the vinylene carbon atoms (Q(C4) + Q(C3)) and the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (E(lumo)). These electronic descriptors were also successful at modeling the toxicity of alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones. The toxicity of a range of acrylates was constant within about 0.2 of a log unit. Conversely, the toxicity of methacrylates and esters containing the vinylene group varied considerably and was explained by their hydrophobicity. The comparison of the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for the methacrylates and esters with that for non-polar narcosis showed little significant difference and hence suggested that substitution on the carbon-carbon double bond in the methacrylates and vinylene unsaturated esters does not enhance toxicity over that of baseline. Substitution on the carbon-carbon double bond in the alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes resulted in toxicity that was similar to that for saturated derivatives. Although an excellent hydrophobicity-dependent QSAR was developed for the esters containing ethynylene group, these compounds are considered to act as Michael-type acceptors. Attempts to combine different groups of Michael-type acceptors into a single QSAR, based on mechanistically derived descriptors, were unsuccessful. Thus, the modeling of the toxicity of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl domain is currently limited to models for narrow subdomains.
Induction of micronuclei and binuclei in blood, gill and liver cells of fishes subchronically exposed to cadmium chloride and copper sulphate.	Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio) and Peppered cory (Corydoras paleatus) were evaluated as target species to perform genotoxicity tests for heavy metals. Fishes were exposed to different doses of cadmium (0.005-0.1 mg/L) and copper (0.01-0.25 mg/L) for 21 days. Hexavalent chromium at a single dose of 5 mg/L was used as a positive control. Frequencies of micronuclei and binuclei were evaluated comparatively in peripheral blood erythrocytes, gill epithelial cells and liver cells. As a result it was observed that, fish species and their tissues showed differential sensitivity to the heavy metal treatment. In general, frequencies of micronucleated and binucleated cells significantly increased following the exposure for 21 days to copper, cadmium and chromium. On the other hand, gill and liver cells showed higher frequencies of micronuclei and binuclei than erythrocytes. Our results indicated the formation of micronuclei and binuclei in fish cells caused by their exposure to cadmium, copper and chromium, thus verifying results obtained earlier on mammals, which indicated that these heavy metals have cytotoxic and genotoxic effects. The suitability of the micronucleus assay in native fish species for the screening of aquatic genotoxicants is highlighted and the importance of target tissue selection in the piscine micronucleus test is emphasized.
Reproductive and neurobehavioural effects of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in a cross-mating toxicity study of mice.	Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was given in the diet to provide levels of 0% (C) or 0.03% (T) from 5 weeks of age of the F0 generation to 9 weeks of age of the F1 generation in mice. At 9 weeks of age, each female was paired with one male from the same or another treatment groups (cross-mating: C/C, T/C, C/T, T/T), for a period of 5 days. The selected reproductive and neurobehavioural parameters were measured. There were no adverse effects of DEHP on either litter size, litter weight and sex ratio at birth. The average body weight of female offspring was significantly affected in group IV (T/T) at PND 14. In behavioural developmental parameters, swimming direction at PND 4 was significantly accelerated in group III (C/T) in female offspring. In movement activity of exploratory behaviour at 3 weeks of age, number of movement of male offspring was significantly affected in group IV (T/T). The dose level of DEHP in the present cross-mating study produced few adverse effects in reproductive and neurobehavioural parameters in mice.
Regulation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase signaling in human osteosarcoma cells stimulated with nicotine.	Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor in the development and further progression of periodontal diseases. Currently, there is limited information on the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) expression in smoking-associated periodontal disease.
Toxicity of tire debris leachates.	Data on the indicators of environmental impact of tire debris, originated from the tire abrasion on roads, are extremely scarce, while it is well known that tires may produce deleterious effects. Tire debris contains significant quantities of zinc (Zn) which may be released by tire rubber. We have used tire particles (TD) produced in laboratory from new rubber. Two sets of experiments were set up to obtain eluates. One set used 50 and 100 g/L TD to produce eluates at pH 3-7. The Zn quantity was measured with a Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry. The eluates at 1%,10%,50%,100% concentrations in culture media were tested on Raphidocelis subcapitata, Daphnia magna and Xenopus laevis embryos (FETAX test). The other set of experiments was performed putting 250 mg/L TD in a column with glass beads to control particle dispersion during the elution process. We demonstrate that factors such as pH, size and particles aggregation deeply influence the elution process, that the amount of Zn leached from particles is related to their aggregation rather than their quantity. These results, even though do not reflect the real environmental toxicity of the leachates, can be successfully used for comparative purposes allowing an initial assessment of the potential effect of tire derived particles.
Heavy metal binding capacity (HMBC) of municipal solid waste landfill leachates.	This research describes the use of a toxicity assay for the identification of metal toxicity, bioavailability and heavy metal binding capacity (HMBC) of municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill leachates. MetPLATE, an assay specific for heavy metal toxicity, was used to determine the HMBC of MSW leachates collected from 14 sites in Florida, with a wide range of chemical and physical characteristics. The leachates displayed a low toxicity which was attributed to the site-specific parameters, including, high concentrations of both organic and inorganic ligands. The HMBC test was undertaken to measure the effect of these site-specific parameters on metal toxicity. The potential for MSW leachate to bind and, thus, detoxify heavy metals was investigated with copper, zinc, and mercury. The HMBC values obtained ranged from 3 to 115, 5 to 93 and 4 to 101 for HMBC-Cu+2, HMBC-Zn+2, and HMBC-Hg+2, respectively. Additionally, the high strength leachates displayed the highest binding capacities, although the landfills sampled represented a wide range of characteristics. For comparison, the HMBC values reported with local lake water, Lake Alice and Lake Beverly, and a wastewater treatment plant effluent were all below 3. A partial fractionation of MSW leachate samples from sites 1, 5 and 8, was conducted to further investigate the influence of selected site-specific physico-chemical parameters on metal binding. The fractionation revealed that the HMBC of the leachate samples was heavily influenced by the concentration of solids, organics and hardness.
Bioaccumulation and harmful effects of microcystin-LR in the aquatic plants Lemna minor and Wolffia arrhiza and the filamentous alga Chladophora fracta.	Although the toxic effects of cyanotoxins on animals have been examined extensively, little research has focused on their effects on higher plants and macroalgae, and the potential for bioaccumulation in the food web through plants. Two aquatic plants, Lemna minor and Wolffia arrhiza, and one filamentous alga, Chladophora fracta, were exposed to the cyanotoxin microcystin-LR. Growth of L. minor (as weight and frond number) and root length were significantly reduced and peroxidase activity was significantly increased after 5 days of exposure to concentrations of 10 and 20 microg mL(-1) microcystin-LR. Growth of W. arrhiza (as frond number) was significantly reduced after 5 days of exposure to 15 microg mL(-1) microcystin-LR. Growth and peroxidase activity of C. fracta were not affected by microcystin-LR at concentrations up to 10 microg mL(-1). L. minor also accumulated microcystin-LR up to a concentration of 0.288 +/- 0.009 ng mg(-1) wet wt. plant material over the 5 days of the experiment, equivalent to an accumulation rate of 0.058 ng mg(-1) day(-1). C. fracta accumulated a microcystin-LR concentration of 0.042 +/- 0.015 ng mg(-1) wet wt. plant material over the 5 days of the experiment, equivalent to an accumulation rate of 0.008 ng mg(-1) day(-1).
Comparison of supervised clustering methods to discriminate genotoxic from non-genotoxic carcinogens by gene expression profiling.	Prediction of the toxic properties of chemicals based on modulation of gene expression profiles in exposed cells or animals is one of the major applications of toxicogenomics. Previously, we demonstrated that by Pearson correlation analysis of gene expression profiles from treated HepG2 cells it is possible to correctly discriminate and predict genotoxic from non-genotoxic carcinogens. Since to date many different supervised clustering methods for discrimination and prediction tests are available, we investigated whether application of the methods provided by the Whitehead Institute and Stanford University improved our initial prediction. Four different supervised clustering methods were applied for this comparison, namely Pearson correlation analysis (Pearson), nearest shrunken centroids analysis (NSC), K-nearest neighbour analysis (KNN) and Weighted voting (WV). For each supervised clustering method, three different approaches were followed: (1) using all the data points for all treatments, (2) exclusion of the samples with marginally affected gene expression profiles and (3) filtering out the gene expression signals that were hardly altered. On the complete data set, NSC, KNN and WV outperformed the Pearson test, but on the reduced data sets no clear difference was observed. Exclusion of samples with marginally affected profiles improved the prediction by all methods. For the various prediction models, gene sets of different compositions were selected; in these 27 genes appeared three times or more. These 27 genes are involved in many different biological processes and molecular functions, such as apoptosis, cell cycle control, regulation of transcription, and transporter activity, many of them related to the carcinogenic process. One gene, BAX, was selected in all 10 models, while ZFP36 was selected in 9, and AHR, MT1E and TTR in 8. Summarising, this study demonstrates that several supervised clustering methods can be used to discriminate certain genotoxic from non-genotoxic carcinogens by gene expression profiling in vitro in HepG2 cells. None of the methods clearly outperforms the others.
In vitro assessment of modes of toxic action of pharmaceuticals in aquatic life.	An ecotoxicological test battery based on a mode-of-action approach was designed and applied to the hazard identification and classification of modes of action of six pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, ethinyl estradiol, ibuprofen, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole). The rationale behind the design of the battery was to cover the relevant interactions that a compound may have with biological targets. It is thus not comprehensive but contains representative examples of each category of mode of toxic action including nonspecific, specific, and reactive toxicity. The test battery consists of one test system for nonspecific toxicity (baseline toxicity or narcosis), two test systems for specific effects, and two test systems for reactive toxicity. The baseline toxicity was quantified with the Kinspec test, which detects membrane leakage via measurements of membrane potential. This test system may also be used to detect the specific effects on energy transduction, although this was not relevant to any compound investigated in this study. As examples of specific receptor-mediated toxicity, we chose the yeast estrogen screen (YES) as a specific test for estrogenicity, and the inhibition of chlorophyll fluorescence in algae to assess specific effects on photosynthesis. Reactive modes of action were assessed indirectly by measuring the relevance of cellular defense systems. Differences in growth inhibition curves between a mutant of Escherichia coli that could not synthesize glutathione and its parent strain indicate the relevance of conjugation with glutathione as a defense mechanism, which is an indirect indicator of protein damage. DNA damage was assessed by comparing the growth inhibition in a strain that lacks various DNA repair systems with that in its competent parent strain. Most compounds acted merely as baseline toxicants in all test systems. As expected, ethinylestradiol was the only compound showing estrogenic activity. Propranolol was baseline-toxic in all test systems exceptforthe photosynthesis inhibition assay, where it surprisingly showed a 100-fold excess toxicity over the predicted baseline effect. The exact mode of toxic action could not be confirmed, but additional chlorophyll fluorescence induction experiments excluded the possibility of direct interference with photosynthesis through photosystem II inhibition. Mixture experiments were performed as a diagnostic tool to analyze the mode of toxic action. Compounds with the same mode of toxic action showed the expected concentration addition. In the photosynthesis inhibition assay, agreement between experimental results and prediction was best for two-stage predictions considering the assigned modes of action. In a two-stage prediction, concentration addition was used as a model to predict the mixture effect of the baseline toxicants followed by their independent action as a single component combined with the specifically acting compound propranolol and the reference compound diuron. A comparison with acute toxicity data for algae, daphnia, and fish showed generally good agreement for the nonspecifically acting compounds but also that the proposed test battery offered better diagnostic value in the case of the specifically acting compounds.
Analysis of quantitative data obtained from toxicity studies showing non-normal distribution.	The data obtained from toxicity studies are examined for homogeneity of variance, but, usually, they are not examined for normal distribution. In this study I examined the measured items of a carcinogenicity/chronic toxicity study with rats for both homogeneity of variance and normal distribution. It was observed that a lot of hematology and biochemistry items showed non-normal distribution. For testing normal distribution of the data obtained from toxicity studies, the data of the concurrent control group may be examined, and for the data that show a non-normal distribution, non-parametric tests with robustness may be applied.
Glial fibrillary acidic protein and related glial proteins as biomarkers of neurotoxicity.	A variety of '-omic' technologies are being increasingly applied in preclinical safety assessments. Such approaches, however, have not been implemented in neurotoxicity safety evaluations. Current regulatory guidelines for assessing neurotoxicity emphasise reliance on traditional histopathological stains and behavioural testing batteries. Although these methods may be sufficient to detect some neurotoxic effects, they lack both the sensitivity and specificity required for broad-scale neurotoxicity screening. The glial reaction to nervous system damage, often termed gliosis, represents a hallmark of all types of nervous system injury. As such, the development and implementation of gliosis biomarkers represents a broadly applicable approach for neurotoxicity safety assessment. Using a panel of known neurotoxic agents, the authors have shown that the astroglial protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), can serve as one such biomarker of neurotoxicity. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of GFAP has shown this biomarker to be a sensitive and specific indicator of the neurotoxic condition. The implementation of GFAP and related glial biomarkers in neurotoxicity screens may serve as the basis for further development of molecular signatures predictive of adverse effects on the nervous system.
Troponin as a marker of myocardiac damage in drug-induced cardiotoxicity.	Cardiac troponins T and I (cTnT and cTnI) are becoming the serum biomarkers of choice for monitoring potential drug-induced myocardial injury in both clinical and preclinical studies. The utility of cardiac troponins has been mainly demonstrated following the administration of antineoplastic drugs and beta-sympathomimetics, although the routine use of these markers in the monitoring in patients who received anthracyclines therapy is far from settled. Unlike the previous markers, which suffered from numerous shortages, the main advantages of cardiac troponins are their high specificity and sensitivity, wide diagnostic window and the possibility to use commercially available assays in clinical settings as well as in a broad range of laboratory animals. Nevertheless, in spite of vigorous research in this area, a number of questions are still unanswered and these are discussed in this review. The main problems seem to be the lack of standardisation of variety of troponin immunoassays, the assessment of suitable cutoff for drug-induced cardiotoxicity and determination of critical diagnostic window related to the optimal timing of sample collection, which may be drug-dependent.
Chemical and ecotoxicological characterization of Columbia River sediments below the Hanford site (USA).	Columbia River sediments were characterized (metals, organics, porewater toxicity) with samples (n=12) from four dams below the Hanford site. Analyses were supplemented with colocated radionuclide data, along with comparable data from the Priest Rapids dam, immediately upriver from Hanford. Although not statistically significant (Bonferroni P>0.05), metals were generally highest at Priest Rapids, relative to downriver dams. Semivolatiles, Aroclors, and organochlorine pesticides were below method reporting limits. Radionuclide differences across locations were minor (Bonferroni P>0.05). Whereas Microtox showed little toxicity, Daphnia IQ tests exhibited measurable toxicity at all locations (EC50 = 22 - 78% porewater). Ecotoxicological benchmarks for metals were exceeded at several locations, most notably at Priest Rapids. Except for K-40, radionuclides were below benchmarks. Overall, chemistry and ecotoxicity results suggested that sediments may pose a risk to benthic biota, likely due to metals (derived largely from upriver mining) or factors associated with a reducing environment (e.g., low oxygen, high ammonia).
Protective effect induced by atropine, carbamates, and 2-pyridine aldoxime methoiodide Artemia salina larvae exposed to fonofos and phosphamidon.	The acute toxicity of fonofos and phosphamidon on three age classes of Artemia salina was evaluated. An increase in toxicity of these organophosphorous (OP) insecticides was found following longer development of A. salina. The effects of pretreatment with the nonselective muscarinic antagonist atropine, the two reversible acetylcholinesterease inhibitors physostigmine and pyridostigmine, and the cholinesterase-reactivating oxime 2-pyridine aldoxime methoiodide (2-PAM), as individual and combined pretreatments, on OP-induced lethality in 24 h Artemia were also investigated. The lethal action of both OP insecticides was prevented by pretreatment of 24 h Artemia with atropine and 2-PAM, while physostigmine proved ineffective against intoxication with both OP insecticides and pyridostigmine exhibited a low synergic effect. In both cases, the inhibitory effects of combinations of atropine (10(-5)M) plus 2-PAM were greater than those elicited by either drug alone, with the maximum protection afforded being 100%. Combined pretreatment of atropine (10(-5)M) plus physostigmine practically abolished the lethal effects induced by both insecticides. Pretreatment with 2-PAM (10(-6)M) plus physostigmine afforded maximal protection of 100% and 76% on the lethality induced by fonofos and phosphamidon, respectively. The data obtained suggest that the combination of atropine plus 2-PAM or physostigmine and the combined pretreatment of 2-PAM plus physostigmine are effective in the prevention of the lethal effects induced by fonofos and phosphamidon in A. salina larvae.
Accumulation and elimination of cadmium in larval stage zebrafish following acute exposure.	A number of recent studies have examined the impact of acute cadmium exposure on early zebrafish development at the morphological, cellular, and molecular levels. However, no information on the accumulation and elimination of cadmium during early life stages of zebrafish development has been available. Here we have quantified cadmium accumulation in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy following short-term acute exposure and recovery periods. Zebrafish (80 h postfertilization) were exposed to various concentrations of cadmium (0.2, 1.0, 5.0, 25, 125 microM) for 3 h. Cadmium accumulation in larvae increased with exposure concentration. After exposure at 5.0, 25, and 125 microM cadmium, the fish were allowed to recover in freshwater for 0, 12, or 24 h. Cadmium content did not show a statistically significant decrease over the recovery period when exposed to 5.0 or 25 microM cadmium, whereas significant losses over the recovery period were observed following 125 microM exposure. These results suggest that the larval zebrafish decrease total cadmium body burden only following relatively high short-term acutely toxic exposures.
Acute toxicity of leachates of tire wear material to Daphnia magna--variability and toxic components.	Large amounts of tire rubber are deposited along the roads due to tread wear. Several compounds may leach from the rubber and cause toxicity to aquatic organisms. To investigate the toxic effects of tire wear material from different tires, rubber was abraded from the treads of twenty-five tires. Leachates were prepared by allowing the rubber to equilibrate with dilution water at 44 degrees C for 72 h. Then the rubber was filtered from the leachates, and test organisms (Daphnia magna) were added. Forty-eight hour EC50s ranged from 0.5 to >10.0 g l(-1). The toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) indicated that non-polar organic compounds caused most of the toxicity. UV exposure of the filtered tire leachates caused no significant increase in toxicity. However, when tested as unfiltered leachates (the rubber was not filtered from the leachates before addition of D. magna) photo-enhanced toxicity was considerable for some tires, which means that test procedures are important when testing tire leachates for aquatic (photo) toxicity. The acute toxicity of tire wear for Daphnia magna was found to be <40 times a predicted environmental concentration based on reports on the concentration of a tire component found in environmental samples, which emphasizes the need for a more extensive risk assessment of tire wear for the environment.
Comparative toxicity of alternative antifouling biocides on embryos and larvae of marine invertebrates.	This study evaluates the impact of commonly used "booster" biocides (chlorothalonil, Sea-Nine 211, dichlofluanid, tolylfluanid and Irgarol 1051) on early developmental stages of marine invertebrates of commercial and ecological relevance. Toxicity tests were conducted with embryos and larvae of the bivalve Mytilus edulis, the sea-urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. Toxicity was quantified in terms of the EC50 (median effective concentration) and EC10 reducing embryogenesis success, larval growth and larval settlement by 50% and 10% respectively. The EC10 and EC50 for chlorothalonil ranged from 2 to 108 and from 25 to 159 nM; for Sea-Nine 211 values were 6-204 and 38-372 nM; for dichlofluanid effective concentrations were 95-830 and 244-4311 nM; tolylfluanid yielded values between 99-631 and 213-2839 nM; and Irgarol 1051 was the least toxic compound showing values from 3145 to >25600 and from 6076 to >25600 nM. Those biocides may be ranked in the following order from highest to lowest toxicity to embryos and larvae of M. edulis, P. lividus and C. intestinalis: chlorothalonil>Sea-Nine 211>dichlofluanid=tolylfluanid>Irgarol 1051. The registered effective concentrations were compared to worst-case environmental concentrations reported in literature in order to evaluate the risk posed by these biocides to those invertebrate species. Our data support that chlorothalonil, Sea-Nine 211 and dichlofluanid predicted levels in marinas represent a threat to M. edulis, P. lividus, and C. intestinalis populations, whilst Irgarol 1051 showed no toxic effects on the biological responses tested here at worst-case environmental concentrations.
Water quality and macroinvertebrate community response following pesticide applications in a banana plantation, Limon, Costa Rica.	Pesticides used in banana production may enter watercourses and pose ecological risks for aquatic ecosystems. The occurrence and effects of pesticides in a stream draining a banana plantation was evaluated using chemical characterization, toxicity testing and macrobenthic community composition. All nematicides studied were detected in the surface waters of the banana plantation during application periods, with peak concentrations following applications. Toxicity tests were limited to the carbofuran application and no toxicity was observed with the acute tests used. However, since pesticide concentrations were generally below the lowest LC50 value for crustaceans but above calculated aquatic quality criteria, there remains a risk of chronic toxicity. Accurate ecological assessments of pesticide use in banana plantations are currently limited by the lack of local short-term chronic toxicity tests and tests using sensitive native species. Relatively constant levels of four pesticides (imazalil, thiabendazole, chlorpyrifos and propiconazole), which had toxic effects according to the 96h hydra and 21d daphnia chronic test, were recorded in the effluent of the packing plant throughout the study, indicating that the solid waste trap used in this facility was not effective in eliminating toxic chemicals. Certain taxa, such as Heterelmis sp. (Elmidae), Heteragrion sp. (Megapodagrionidae, Odonata), Caenis sp. (Caenidae, Ephemerotera), and Smicridea sp. (Hidropsychidae, Trichoptera), were more abundant at reference sites than in the banana farm waters, and may be good candidates for toxicity testing. Multivariate analyses of the macroinvertebrate communities clearly showed that the banana plantation sites were significantly different from the reference sites. Moreover, following the pesticide applications, all the banana plantation sites showed significant changes in community composition, with the same genera being affected at all sites and for all pesticides (terbufos, cadusafos and carbofuran). Consequently, the results presented here show that multivariate analysis of community composition was more sensitive in distinguishing pesticide effects than the toxicity tests and richness and composition measures used. We conclude that monitoring macroinvertebrate communities can be a powerful tool in the assessment of ecological effects of banana production.
Bioconcentration and depuration of copper, cadmium, and zinc mixtures by the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca.	The uptake and elimination of copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), and zinc (Zn) by the amphipod Hyalella azteca during exposure to the metals singly and in various combinations was examined in controlled laboratory experiments. In single metal exposures the accumulation of all metals was rapid and increased with exposure time. Copper elimination was slower compared to that for zinc and for cadmium no elimination was detected after 5 days in clean water. In the two-metal mixtures it appears that the presence of one metal influenced the bioconcentration of the other, since the bioconcentration factor (BCF) for copper was higher in the presence of cadmium than in the presence of zinc and in the case of cadmium, the decrease of K(1) values from cadmium single exposure to the binary and tertiary mixtures suggests possible inhibition of cadmium uptake by the other metals. In the case of the three-metal mixture the situation is less clear, with both increased and decreased BCFs recorded, in comparison to single-metal and two-metal mixtures, suggesting both stimulation and inhibition of metal accumulation.
Avian transgenerational reproductive toxicity test with in ovo exposure.	Ecological risk assessment of environmental pollutants requires effective laboratory assays and extrapolation of the resultant data to wild species. Because avian reproductive disorder and accumulation of persistent compounds in wild birds and their eggs have long been observed in polluted regions, we have developed an assay for investigating whether pollutants accumulated in eggs impair the reproduction of the exposed birds and the survival of the next generation using the Japanese quail. A typical estrogenic compound, diethylstilbestrol (DES), dissolved in olive oil was injected into the air-chamber of fertilized eggs on day 10 of incubation. After sexual maturation of hatched chicks, we mated pairs of male and female quails following an observation period of egg production and collected their eggs. The collected eggs were incubated and checked for the fertility and hatchability, and then the hatchlings were raised and observed in growth for 3 weeks. A dosage of 5 ng/g per egg of DES caused eggshell thinning in eggs laid by exposed females and reduction in eggshell strength. DES also induced shortening of the left oviduct and unexpected development of the right oviduct, while testis weight was reduced symmetrically. The ability of quail pairs to produce offspring was significantly diminished by exposure of females to DES independently of exposure of males, which mainly arose from production of abnormal and inviable eggs. Fertility of normal-shelled eggs and hatchability of fertilized eggs were unchanged regardless of treatments. External morphological abnormalities, which were mostly unopened toes of the foot, were frequently observed in hatchlings from exposed males independently of exposure of females. Additionally, we attempted to extrapolate the experimental results to the northern bobwhite and to predict population trends for quails in a polluted habitat using a population projection model composed of a combination of a Leslie matrix and the logistic equation. In the event of accumulation of an estrogenic compound equivalent to a dosage of 5 ng/g DES in quail eggs, the average population size was predicted to decrease by 20.2% after 1 year, to approximately half after 4 years, and to a fifth after 14 years. When observed weakening of individuals and the risk of egg breakage are taken into consideration, the decline in population was further accelerated. The proposed assay appears to be suitable not only for assessing adverse effects of chemicals on avian reproduction but for population projection of affected wild birds.
Sediment quality in Rio Guadiamar (SW, Spain) after a tailing dam collapse: contamination, toxicity and bioavailability.	An integrated assessment of sediment quality in the Guadiamar River after a mining spill was conducted. The concentration of different metals and other conventional parameters were measured in sediments located along the river. Four sediment toxicity tests (Hyalella azteca 28-day survival and growth test; Chironomus riparius 10-day survival and growth test; Hexagenia spp. 21-day survival and growth test; and Tubifex tubifex 28-day reproduction and survival test) were carried out to determine the effects associated with the accidental spill. The geochemical fractions of 6 metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd) were determined to establish the bioavailability of the metals. The relationship found in the concentrations of metals associated with the mobile fractions of the sediments in the sites studied is similar to the toxic mud from tailing pond and confirms that the toxic effects are associated with the metals Zn and Cd originating from the spill.
Modelling chronic exposure to contaminated soil: a toxicokinetic approach with the terrestrial snail Helix aspersa.	To enlarge the possibilities of using organisms of the soil fauna to assess the bioaccumulative potential of chemicals, the kinetic of soil cadmium (Cd) transfer to the terrestrial gastropod Helix aspersa was investigated under laboratory conditions during a long-term experiment (6 months). During the exposure phase (3 months), juvenile snails were subjected to three different concentrations of Cd spiked in artificial ISO soil (ISO 0, 20 and 100 mg Cd kg(-1)) and to a field soil (ME4) industrially contaminated by 20 mg Cd kg (-1). For both soils, internal steady-state Cd concentrations were reached in the viscera of the snails, the main storage organ for Cd, after 2 weeks of exposure whatever the Cd concentration in soil. The equilibrium concentrations in the viscera were 0.7 (+/-0.1), 11.3 (+/-2.4), 73.3 (+/-4.8) and 6.3 (+/-1.3) mg Cd kg(-1) dry mass for ISO 0, ISO 20, ISO 100 and ME4, respectively. During the depuration phase (3 months), from 0 to 52% of the accumulated Cd in the viscera were removed by excretion or relocation in the foot. However, the snails were not able to depurate down to initial concentrations. Data were modelled by integrating a specific growth rate constant into one-compartment toxicokinetic models. This allowed the calculation of Cd uptake rates that can be used as indicators of metal bioavailability. Since this parameter was found to be lower for snails exposed to the field soil ME4, we concluded that lower Cd bioavailability in this field soil was responsible of the lower transfer to the snails compared to the ISO 20 soil, even though they were polluted to similar extents. Internal validation showed that the toxicokinetic models could be applied for predictive purposes, promising for the development of a bioaccumulation directive for terrestrial environment.
Phototransformation of the insecticide fipronil: identification of novel photoproducts and evidence for an alternative pathway of photodegradation.	Fipronil is a recently discovered insecticide of the phenylpyrazole series. It has a highly selective biochemical mode of action, which has led to its use in a large number of important agronomical, household, and veterinary applications. Previous studies have shown that, during exposure to light, fipronil is converted into a desulfurated derivative (desulfinyl-fipronil), which has slightly reduced insecticidal activity. In this study, the photodegradation of fipronil was studied in solution at low light intensities (sunlight or UV lamp). In addition to desulfinyl-fipronil, a large number of minor photoproducts were observed, including diversely substituted phenylpyrazole derivatives and aniline derivatives that had lost the pyrazole ring. Desulfinylfipronil itself was shown to be relatively stable under both UV light and sunlight, with only limited changes occurring in the substitution of the aromatic ring. Since this compound accumulated to levels corresponding to only 30-55% of the amount of fipronil degraded, it was concluded that one or more alternative pathways of photodegradation must be operating. On the basis of the structurally identified photoproducts, it is proposed that fipronil photodegradation occurs via at least two distinct pathways, one of which involves desulfuration at the 4-position of the pyrazole ring giving the desulfinyl derivative and the other of which involves a different modification of the 4-substituent, leading to cleavage of the pyrazole ring and the formation of aniline derivatives. The latter compounds do not accumulate to high levels and may, therefore, be degraded further. The ecological significance of these results is discussed, particularly with regard to the insecticidal activity of the photoproducts.
Dose-mortality assessment on municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) ash.	This study provides a novel attempt to put forward, in general toxicological terms, quantitative series of toxicity of various ashes of municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) for reusability in various applications. Previous study disclosed that growth inhibition of Escherichia coli DH5alpha occurred at concentrations above 0.156, 0.625 and 0.0195 gL(-1) for bottom ash (BA), cyclone ash (CA), scrubber ash (SA), respectively, suggesting the toxicity series of SA>BA>CA. However, the severity of such a toxicity series was not clearly revealed, thus whether ashes were still feasible for reuse in further applications was still remained uncertain. Compared to NaNO3, CrCl2 and CdCl2, the existing toxicities of ashes were apparently significant even these ashes were all satisfied by the TCLP guidelines for EPA regulations. Dose-response analysis based upon loss of cell viability (e.g., EC50) stated a toxicity series of SA>CrCl2>BA>CdCl2>CA>NaNO3. The ranking of Hill slope B in BA>SA>CA>NaNO3>CrCl2>CdCl2 clearly suggested the smallest tolerance (e.g., ranges from EC20 to EC50) for ashes very likely due to synergistic toxicity of multiple species present in ashes. The findings showed that toxicity attenuation of ashes should be the first-ranking task prior to practical reuse and recycle in applications.
A larval medaka (Oryzias latipes) acute toxicity assay combined with solid-phase extraction to efficiently determine the toxicity of organic contaminants in river water.	Using a larval medaka (Oryzias latipes) acute toxicity assay combined with solid-phase extraction, we proposed a method for efficiently determining the fish toxicity of organic contaminants in river water. Organic toxicants were 10, 20, 50 and 100-fold concentrated from 4 L of the sample with adsorption cartridges. The lethal effect was observed by exposing every ten individuals of 48-72 h old larval medaka to 20 mL of each solution for 48h. The median lethal concentration rate (LCR50) was used as an indicator for the toxicity. With the developed toxicity test method, more than seven times difference was found in the LCR50 of the river water samples. LCR50 distribution profiles were compared with 125 samples in two typical rivers. The result revealed a lower toxicity level in the mainstream than in the confluences, and a lower toxicity level in Sagami River than in Ayase River. LCR50 proved unique as a toxicity indicator, which was impossible to speculate from the conventional water quality indicator of the dissolved organic carbon concentration. As an effective screening test for priority settings, the method can help us with an efficient planning for the environmental investigation and management.
Bioassay-directed identification of toxic organic compounds in creosote-contaminated groundwater.	Despite the fact that creosote mainly consists of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), more polar compounds like phenolics, benzenes and N-, S-, O-heterocyclics dominate the groundwater downstream from creosote-contaminated sites. In this study, bioassay-directed fractionation, combined with fullscan GC-MS, identified organic toxicants in creosote-contaminated groundwater. An organic extract of creosote-contaminated groundwater was fractionated on a polar silica column using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the toxicity of the fractions was measured by the Microtox-bioassay. PAHs, which comprise up to 85% of pure creosote, accounted for only about 13% of total toxicity in the creosote-contaminated groundwater, while methylated benzenes, phenolics and N-heterocyclics accounted for ca. 80% of the measured toxicity. The fraction containing alkylated quinolines was the most toxic single fraction, accounting for 26% of the total measured toxicity. The results imply that focus on PAHs may underestimate risks associated with creosote-contaminated groundwater, and that environmental risk assessment should focus to a higher degree on substituted PAHs and phenolics because they are more toxic than the unsubstituted ones. Additionally, benzenes and N-heterocyclics (e.g., alkylated quinolines) should be assessed.
The infectivity of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy agent at low doses: the importance of phospholipid.	The issue of whether the mechanism of infection is independent or co-operative for low doses of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agent is critical for risk assessment. The susceptibility (and hence ID(50)) of individuals with the same prion protein (PrP) genotype may vary considerably with a small proportion being very susceptible. Assuming independent action, the incubation period (IP) would continue to increase until the dose is below the ID(50) of the most susceptible individuals in the experiment, at which point it would become constant. This may explain the observed increase in IP with decreasing dose below the apparent ID(50) in experiments with untreated TSE agent. In contrast, IPs for autoclaved or NaOH-treated TSE agent increase greatly at doses <ID(50) suggesting strong co-operative action, or even a threshold. It is proposed here that the unit of infectivity for prion disease is a nucleation seed comprised of PrP and host phospholipid (PL). PL would play a structural role through mediating protein/lipid interactions with PrP. Heating or alkali treatment destroys the PL breaking up the nucleation seeds, which require long IPs to reform at low doses. Replenishing those inactivated PLs with host PL would explain how the phenotypic effect of long IP at low dose is lost on subpassage. It is proposed here that strain thermostability is controlled by the nature and strength of the PrP/PL interactions, which are independent of the host PrP genotype. Although repeated oral exposure to low doses of scrapie is less harmful than a single large exposure, this effect may reflect interference by competition rather than diminished risks due to a co-operative effect, and is of little importance for 'one-off' low-dose environmental exposures.
Toxigenicity testing of clinical isolates of non-typhoidal salmonellae in Vero cell culture & Caenorhabditis elegans model.	The non-typhoidal salmonellae (NTS) are recognized agents of gastroenteritis worldwide. Some of the NTS do not produces cytotoxic changes in tissue culture and not much is known about the endotoxicity of the clinical isolates of NTS (mostly Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis). We examined the exotoxic (cytotoxin) and endotoxic activity of clinical isolates of NTS in two assay models namely Vero cell culture and the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Bacteria-free culture supernatants of 40 isolates NTS were tested in 96 well microtitre plate containing confluent monolayers of Vero cells. For the effects on C. elegans, the worms were exposed to bacteria free culture supernatants in 24 well microtitre plate for 24 h and then transferred to OP50 Escherichia coli lawn culture. The endotoxic activity of the live bacterium was studied by feeding the worms in the lawn culture of NTS separately. No cytopathic effect was observed with NTS tested in Vero cell culture assay. Likewise, the worms exposed to the bacteria-free culture supernatants were found active up to 7 days. In the co-culture killing assay, worms were found dead with characteristic stiff and straight appearance by 16(th) day. The worms were alive up to 21 days in OP50 E. coli. Bacteria-free culture supernatants did not have any deleterious effect on worms or in Vero cell culture, suggesting that there is no soluble toxic factor (diffusible toxin) in the culture supernatants. However, live NTS were found to be lethal to the worms; indicating that direct interaction between viable NTS and C. elegans is necessary for killing.
Local lymph node assay (LLNA) for detection of sensitization capacity of chemicals.	The local lymph node assay (LLNA) is a murine model developed to evaluate the skin sensitization potential of chemicals. The LLNA is an alternative approach to traditional guinea pig methods and in comparison provides important animal welfare benefits. The assay relies on measurement of events induced during the induction phase of skin sensitization, specifically lymphocyte proliferation in the draining lymph nodes which is a hallmark of a skin sensitization response. Since its introduction the LLNA has been the subject of extensive evaluation on a national and international scale, and has been successfully validated and incorporated worldwide into regulatory guidelines. Experience gained in recent years has demonstrated that adherence to published procedures and guidelines for the LLNA (e.g., with respect to dose and vehicle selection) is critical for the successful conduct and eventual interpretation of the data. In addition to providing a robust method for skin sensitization hazard identification, the LLNA has proven very useful in assessing the skin sensitizing potency of test chemicals, and this has provided invaluable information to risk assessors. The primary method to make comparisons of the relative potency of chemical sensitizers is to use linear interpolation to estimate the concentration of chemical required to induce a stimulation index of three relative to concurrent vehicle-treated controls (EC3). In certain situations where there are available less than optimal dose response data a log-linear extrapolation method can be used to estimate an EC3 value which can reduce significantly the need for repeat testing of chemicals. The LLNA, when conducted according to published guidelines, provides a robust method for skin sensitization testing that not only provides reliable hazard identification information but also data necessary for effective risk assessment and risk management.
Antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of Thespesia populnea bark extract.	The ethanolic extract of Thespesia populnea bark (TPE) was investigated for anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity at the doses (p.o.) of 100, 200 and 400mg/kg body weight. For evaluation of inflammation carrageenan-, histamine- and serotonin-induced paw edema served as acute models and formaldehyde-induced arthritis served as a chronic model in rats. The acetic acid-induced writhing response and formalin-induced paw licking time in the early and late phases of mice were used to assess analgesic activity. The higher doses of TPE (200 and 400mg/kg, p.o.) were inhibiting carrageenan, histamine and serotonin-induced paw edema as well as formaldehyde-induced arthritis successfully. In addition, TPE (200 and 400mg/kg, p.o.) significantly attenuated the writhing responses induced by an intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid and late phase of pain response induced by an subplantar injection of formalin in mice. Furthermore, our phytochemical studies indicated that the ethanolic extract of bark contains alkaloids, carbohydrates, protein, tannins, phenols, flavonoids, gums and mucilage, saponins and terpenes. From acute oral toxicity studies (OECD-423 guidelines), no mortality was observed even at highest dose of TPE (2000mg/kg, p.o.).
Metal toxicity to Chlorella pyrenoidosa assessed by a short-term continuous test.	This study presents the metal toxicity as revealed by Chlorella pyrenoidosa using a short-term continuous test and the conventional batch test. Toxicity tests were conducted in a chemostat with a test duration of 1 day. Toxicity data of five different metals (Cd, Pb, Co, Ni, and Zn) derived from the continuous test were compared against results from the conventional batch tests. The batch test is characterized by its saturated nutrient status for algal growth and, on the other hand, the continuous test is conducted at a nutrient-limiting condition simulating more closely to the aquatic field environment. The continuous test consistently yielded smaller EC(50) values, which indicated that alga in the chemostat is approximately four to six times more sensitive than those from the batch culture. Similar phenomena between the two types of tests were observed based on the NOEC values. Compared to literature data (US EPA ECOTOX Database) from the same species of alga, differences in test sensitivity between the batch tests and chemostat technique varied from 9.25 to 160 times. Such distinct differences indicate that current toxicity database may not adequately reflect the impact of various metal toxicants on C. pyrenoidosa. The continuous test method presented herein is a sensitive and rapid assessment technique and, therefore, has a potential for more general applications such as routine checkup for regulatory purposes.
Acute and subacute toxicity of Salvia scutellarioides in mice and rats.	The acute and subacute toxicity of the aqueous extract of Salvia scutellarioides (Lamiaceae) was studied in mice and rats. In the acute toxicity test, oral administration of 2g/kg of Salvia scutellarioides produced neither mortality nor changes in behavior or any other physiological activities. In subacute toxicity studies, no mortality was observed when the two doses of 1 or 2g/kgday of aqueous extract of Salvia scutellarioides extract were administered orally for a period of 28 days. In the blood chemistry analysis, no significant changes occurred, including glucose, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, conjugated billirrubin, total billirrubin, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, total protein, albumin, prothrombin time (PT) and thromboplastin partial time (PTT) of both sexes. Hematological analysis showed no differences in any of the parameters examined (WBC count, platelet and hemoglobin estimation) in either the control or treated group of both sexes. The urinalysis was negative for glucose, ketonic bodies, casts, red blood cells, and albumin in the control and treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the body and organ weights between controls and treated animals of both sexes. Pathologically, neither gross abnormalities nor histopathological changes were observed.
Mitochondrial involvement in Atuna racemosa induced toxicity.	Our group has developed a system to extract information regarding potential novel pharmaceuticals from historic herbal texts. We have shown that one of the plants identified through this technique has the purported antibacterial properties suggested by the text. Here, the toxicity of this antibacterial extract was examined. Using a Jurkat cell model, a therapeutic window between the minimal inhibitory concentration for Gram-positive bacteria and the dose-dependent toxicity of the Atuna racemosa extract was established. Using cells with a mutated caspase 8, it was shown that the toxicity does not involve caspase 8. However, by transmission electron microscopy and a potentiometric dye, the toxicity was shown to involve the mitochondria. This toxicity also resulted in DNA cleavage and activation of caspase 3. This work suggests that the extract, originally reported as an antimicrobial therapeutic in a 400-year-old Dutch herbal text, may maintain a therapeutic window as an antibiotic. Furthermore, this work shows toxicity would occur in a mitochondrial dependent fashion.
In vivo micronucleus test with flow cytometry after acute and chronic exposures of rats to chemicals.	The use of flow cytometry with rat peripheral blood erythrocytes is expected to increase the sensitivity of the in vivo micronucleus test and allows assessment of the genotoxic effects at doses that may be equal or close to those relevant to human exposure. However, there was a limitation to the use of rat peripheral blood erythrocytes since the spleen selectively removes micronucleated erythrocytes from circulation. In the present study, the selective analysis by flow cytometry of young MN-PCEs (micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes or reticulocytes) by use of anti-CD71 antibodies was intended to compensate for the splenic clearance of micronucleated erythrocytes. The young polychromatic erythrocytes have on their surface a specific marker (CD71 antigen) that decreases in density during the maturation process. To investigate the usefulness of the flow cytometric micronucleus analysis combined with anti-CD71 staining of reticulocytes several compounds were tested in acute or sub-chronic treatment regimens. Furthermore, an evaluation was conducted in comparison with the standard rat bone-marrow micronucleus test with additional compounds. The results of acute studies with intraperitoneal application of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) and mitomycin C (MMC) (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg), were comparable to data published in the literature. Sub-chronic experiments were performed with cyclophosphamide (CP) (1, 2, 4 and 8 mg/(kg day)), colchicine (6, 8 mg/(kg day)) and mitomycin C (0.1 mg/(kg day)) and showed dose- and time-dependent accumulation of MN-PCEs. Parallel analysis of micronucleus induction in peripheral blood and bone marrow performed with Novartis compounds up to the highest tested dose (5 mg/kg of compound A, 200 mg/kg of compound B and 1250 mg/kg of compound C) showed concordant results. Furthermore, we performed kinetic studies of micronucleus induction in peripheral blood samples obtained at various times after a single treatment with 10 mg/kg CP and with 6 or 8 mg/kg of colchicine. Such experiments gave important supplementary information about the time course of micronucleus induction. Our data suggest that the peripheral blood flow-cytometry micronucleus test can be used for the assessment of micronucleus induction after acute and chronic exposures of rats to chemicals.
Enzyme and fungal treatments and a combination thereof reduce olive mill wastewater phytotoxicity on Zea mays L. seeds.	The phytotoxicity of olive-mill wastewater (OMW) has been suggested to be mainly due to its phenolic components. This study investigated the impact of three different low-cost dephenolization treatments on the wastewater phytotoxicity. To this aim, germinability of maize (Zea mays L.) seeds sown on a sandy-loamy soil which had been spread with different volumes (from 40 to 160m(3)ha(-1)) of either biologically-treated OMW or relative incubation control was determined. Biological treatments included either Panus tigrinus liquid cultures or incubation with commercial laccase (1UIml(-1)) or an innovative sequential combination of laccase and P. tigrinus cultures. All treatments markedly reduced phytotoxicity and promising results were obtained with commercial laccase. In fact, germinability and mean germination times in soil spread with laccase-treated OMW, did not significantly differ from those observed in soil irrigated with tap water (control) up to OMW volumes of 120m(3)ha(-1). Although the highest phenol reduction (ca. 81%) was obtained by the sequential use of laccase and P. tigrinus, the feasibility of the enzyme treatment is undoubtedly more convincing under the technological point of view.
Lack of immunogenicity of ice structuring protein type III HPLC12 preparation administered by the oral route to human volunteers.	Before a novel protein can be used in foods, its potential allergenicity must be assessed. In this study, healthy volunteers consumed ice structuring protein (ISP) Type III preparation or a control material 5 days a week for a total of 8 weeks. General measures of health were recorded during the study, and the immunogenicity of the protein was assessed by monitoring the levels of IgG and IgE antibodies specific for ISP Type III. The participants remained in good health throughout the study and during the 4 week follow-up period. No IgG or IgE antibodies specific for ISP Type III were detected in the blood of the participants. Investigations of immunogenicity in man have not been previously applied in the context of safety evaluation and they do not form part of the regimens proposed for the evaluation of protein allergenicity. Consequently no standardised protocols exist for such studies, nor any background against which to interpret the results. Nevertheless, the absence of an immune response using a protocol which could have been expected to result in a response with a strongly immunogenic protein, confirms the conclusions of earlier published work, and attests to the lack of allergenicity of ISP Type III preparation.
Induction of oxidative stress in erythrocytes of male rats subchronically exposed to a mixture of eight metals found as groundwater contaminants in different parts of India.	Exposure of animals and humans to different metal components through contaminated drinking water can result in a wide range of adverse clinical conditions. Toxicological consequences arising from the concurrent repeated exposure to multiple metal contaminants are not known. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the oxidative stress-inducing potential of a mixture of eight metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, chromium, nickel, manganese, iron), representative of groundwater contamination in different areas of India, in erythrocytes of male rats subchronically exposed to environmentally relevant doses via drinking water. The selection of these metals, as determined by literature survey of groundwater contamination in India, was primarily based on the frequency of their occurrence and contamination level above World Health Organization maximum permissible limit (MPL) in drinking water. Male albino Wistar rats were exposed to the metal mixture at 0, 1, 10, and 100 times the mode concentrations (the most frequently occurring concentration) of the individual metals in drinking water for 90 days. In addition, one group of rats was also exposed to the mixture at a concentration equal to the MPL of individual components. The oxidative stress in erythrocytes was evaluated by assessing the magnitude of malondialdehyde production and reduced glutathione (GSH) content and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR) after 30, 60, and 90 days of exposure. MPL and 1x dose levels did not cause any changes. The mixture at 10x and 100x doses caused dose- and time-dependent effects. After 30 days, the 10x dose did not cause any changes except increase in SOD activity. The 100x dose increased the activities of SOD, catalase and GR and the GSH level, but caused no alterations in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and GPx activity. After 60 days, the 10x dose did not cause any changes. The 100x dose increased LPO and decreased all the antioxidant parameters, except GSH. After 90 days, both 10x and 100x levels elevated LPO. The 10x dose decreased GSH level and activities of SOD and catalase, but not of GPx and GR, whereas the 100x dose decreased all the antioxidative systems. Overall, the present study demonstrates that the subchronic exposure of male rats to the mixture of metals via drinking water results in induction of oxidative stress and concomitant reduction in antioxidative defense system in erythrocytes at 10 and 100 times the mode concentrations of the individual metals in contaminated groundwater.
Impact of waterborne copper on the structure of gills and hepatopancreas and its impact on the content of metallothionein in juvenile giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (Crustacea: Decapoda).	This study aims to elucidate both the impact of copper on the structure of the gills and hepatopancreas and the induction of metallothionein (MT) during waterborne copper exposure in juvenile Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Structural observations were performed with light microscopy, and the MT titrations were performed with the cadmium saturation assay. The structural changes that occurred in the gills and hepatopancreas appeared to result from copper accumulation, and the degree of damage observed in both tissues was relevant to the elevated waterborne copper concentration. Exposure to copper concentrations ranging from 0.01 mg/L to 0.4 mg/L for 7 days resulted in profound structural changes including the accumulation of hemocytes in the hemocoelic space; swelling and fusion of the lamellae; abnormal gill tips; and hyperplastic, necrotic, and clavate-globate lamellae in the gills. Similarly, hemocytic infiltration in the interstitial sinuses, an increased number of hemocytes, thickening and ruptures of the basal laminae, and necrosis of the tubules were observed in the hepatopancreas. The MT measurements showed no significant differences in MT contents between the control group and the group treated with 0.01 mg/L waterborne copper. The maximum MT content was observed at the level of 0.4 mg/L waterborne copper.
Detection of micronucleus and abnormal nucleus in erythrocytes from the gill and kidney of Labeo bata cultivated in sewage-fed fish farms.	Determination of genotoxic effect in fish, micronucleus test as well as the study of the abnormal shape of nuclei is a suitable measure, in which the presence or absence of genotoxins can be detected in water. In the present study, micronuclei and abnormal nuclei frequencies were scored in the gill and kidney erythrocytes of the fish Labeo bata grown in the sewage-fed fish farms of East Calcutta wetlands. Three experimental sites were chosen, namely, Bantala, Chowbaga and Chingrihata (basically these sites have sewage-fed fishponds), which were compared with fishponds of no sewage influence as the control area. Highly significant differences (P<0.001) were noticed for micronucleus frequencies in the gill and kidney erythrocytes of experimental fishes, where kidney erythrocytes showed an increased value than gill erythrocytes without any statistical differences. The frequencies of nuclear abnormalities such as necrotic cells, apoptotic cells, notch nucleated cells and binucleated cells were also counted separately for gill and kidney erythrocytes, in which significantly (P<0.001, P<0.01, P<0.05) increased values were obtained in comparison to control populations. These genotoxicity results confirmed that the sewage-fed ponds contain genotoxic metals such as Cr, Zn, Cu, Pb, Mn, Fe through wastewater and sludge because of the direct use of sewage water without pretreatment which may lead to health risks among humans through chronic consumption of fish from these experimental fish ponds. Other vertebrates grown in sewage-fed ponds may also suffer a certain amount of genotoxic substances.
Review on the toxicity, occurrence, metabolism, detoxification, regulations and intake of zearalenone: an oestrogenic mycotoxin.	Zearalenone (ZEA) is a mycotoxin produced mainly by fungi belonging to the genus Fusarium in foods and feeds. It is frequently implicated in reproductive disorders of farm animals and occasionally in hyperoestrogenic syndromes in humans. There is evidence that ZEA and its metabolites possess oestrogenic activity in pigs, cattle and sheep. However, ZEA is of a relatively low acute toxicity after oral or interperitoneal administration in mice, rat and pig. The biotransformation for ZEA in animals involves the formation of two metabolites alpha-zearalenol (alpha-ZEA) and beta-zearalenol (beta-ZEA) which are subsequently conjugated with glucuronic acid. Moreover, ZEA has also been shown to be hepatotoxic, haematotoxic, immunotoxic and genotoxic. The exact mechanism of ZEA toxicity is not completely established. This paper gives an overview about the acute, subacute and chronic toxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, carcinogenicity, genotoxicity and immunotoxicity of ZEA and its metabolites. ZEA is commonly found on several foods and feeds in the temperate regions of Europe, Africa, Asia, America and Oceania. Recent data about the worldwide contamination of foods and feeds by ZEA are considered in this review. Due to economic losses engendered by ZEA and its impact on human and animal health, several strategies for detoxifying contaminated foods and feeds have been described in the literature including physical, chemical and biological process. Dietary intakes of ZEA were reported from few countries from the world. The mean dietary intakes for ZEA have been estimated at 20 ng/kgb.w./day for Canada, Denmark and Norway and at 30 ng/kgb.w./day for the USA. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) established a provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) for ZEA of 0.5 microg/kg of body weight.
The FEMA GRAS assessment of aromatic substituted secondary alcohols, ketones, and related esters used as flavor ingredients.	This publication is the 11th in a series of safety evaluations performed by the Expert Panel of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA). In 1993, the Panel initiated a comprehensive program to re-evaluate the safety of more than 1700 GRAS flavoring substances under conditions of intended use. The list of GRAS substances has now grown to more than 2100 substances. Elements that are fundamental to the safety evaluation of flavor ingredients include exposure, structural analogy, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and toxicology. Flavor ingredients are evaluated individually and in the context of the available scientific information on the group of structurally related substances. In this monograph, a detailed interpretation is presented on the renal carcinogenic potential of the aromatic secondary alcohol alpha-methylbenzyl alcohol, aromatic ketone benzophenone, and corresponding alcohol benzhydrol. The relevance of these effects to the flavor use of these substances is also discussed. The group of aromatic substituted secondary alcohols, ketones, and related esters was reaffirmed as GRAS (GRASr) based, in part, on their rapid absorption, metabolic detoxication, and excretion in humans and other animals; their low level of flavor use; the wide margins of safety between the conservative estimates of intake and the no-observed-adverse effect levels determined from subchronic and chronic studies and the lack of significant genotoxic and mutagenic potential.
The safety of New Zealand bovine colostrum: nutritional and physiological evaluation in rats.	The potential detrimental effects of two different oral doses of bovine colostrum were assessed in young rats according to OECD guidelines. Colostrum was supplemented at 3% and 10% into a normal rat chow. A control group received the rat chow with no supplementation. After 90 days there was no difference between colostrum-fed animals and the control group in body weight, food consumption, clinical signs, haematology and most parameters of blood chemistry including carbohydrate metabolism, liver function and kidney function. The only effects of statistical significance were a decrease in serum cholesterol concentration in the rats receiving 10% colostrum (p<0.025), and a 33% increase in serum triglyceride concentration in the rats receiving 3% colostrum (p<0.005) although this was not apparent in the 10% colostrum group. Further, histological examination of most organs and tissues confirmed that there were no apparent differences between the animals receiving colostrum compared to controls. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the young growing rats had no observed toxicological and histopathological abnormalities caused by colostrum at the levels of supplementation used.
Adult male rats sub-chronically exposed to diphenyl diselenide: Effects on their progeny.	The present study was conducted to evaluate the toxicity of diphenyl diselenide [(PhSe)2] exposure on the progeny of Wistar male rats. Male rats were exposed to (PhSe)2 subcutaneously for 4 weeks at the dose of 5.0 mg/kg and 8 weeks at the dose of 2.5 mg/kg, prior to mating with unexposed females. No lethality was noted in any group. At term of exposure period, 4-week exposed male rats presented significant decrease in the body weight. Sex organ weights were similar in (PhSe)2-exposed and control male groups. The number of implantation sites in females mated with males exposed to (PhSe)2 for 8 weeks was significantly higher than those of the respective control group. Male exposure to (PhSe)2, administered for 4 and 8 weeks, did not change fetal body weight. Gross examination of fetuses from 4- to 8-week exposed groups did not reveal the appearance of external anomalies. Examination of live fetuses for ossification centers did not show significantly difference between groups. No increase in the incidence of skeletal anomalies was observed in fetuses obtained from females impregnated with (PhSe)2-exposed males. The current study indicated that (PhSe)2 given sub-chronically (4 or 8 weeks) to male rats had no adverse effects on their progeny.
Influence of phosphate on the response of periphyton to atrazine exposure.	After indications from the literature that nutrient concentrations may modify the toxicity of herbicides to natural periphyton communities, this study aims to provide experimental proof for atrazine. In this microcosm experiment, phosphate (P) addition did not ameliorate atrazine toxicity to periphyton. Three weeks of P addition did not increase atrazine tolerance (measured as EC50 in acute toxicity tests), whereas exposure to atrazine under conditions that were either P-limited or non-P-limited clearly reduced the development of algal biomass. Long-term exposure to atrazine induced tolerance of the community to the herbicide, and this was not influenced by P addition. Tolerance induction in this microcosm experiment has been compared with previously published field data from the same area of study and indicates that tolerance induction by atrazine may take place under atrazine exposure in streams as well as in microcosms.
Reproductive effects in male rats exposed to diuron.	Diuron is a ureic herbicide considered to have very low toxicity. The present study evaluated several aspects of reproductive toxicity of diuron in adult male rats. Diuron was diluted in corn oil and administered by oral gavage to groups of 18-20 rats at doses of 0, 125 or 250 mg/kg per day for 30 days; the control group received only the corn oil vehicle. At the end of the treatment period, approximately half the animals from each group were assigned to one of two terminal assessment lines: (1) reproductive organ, liver and kidney weights; measurement of diuron concentrations in liver and kidney; plasma testosterone determinations; evaluation of daily sperm production per testis; sperm number and sperm transit time in the epididymis; or (2) sexual behavior assessment during cohabitation with a receptive female; fertility and pregnancy outcome after natural mating; testicular, epididymal, kidney and liver histopathology; sperm morphology. After 30 days of oral diuron treatment, there were no treatment-related changes in body weights, but dose-related diuron residues were detected in the liver of all treated rats and absolute and relative liver weights were increased in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the treated and control groups obtained in plasma testosterone concentrations, or in parameters of daily sperm production, sperm reserves in the epididymis, sperm morphology or measured components of male sexual behavior. On the other hand, the number of fetuses in the litters from diuron-treated rats was slightly smaller than litters from control rats. Therefore, although the results did not indicate that diuron exposure resulted in direct male reproductive toxicity in the rat, they suggest that additional studies should be undertaken to investigate the possible effects on fertility and reproductive performance.
Evaluation of developmental toxicity of amitraz in Sprague-Dawley rats.	This study investigated the potential adverse effects of amitraz on the initiation and maintenance of pregnancy in Sprague-Dawley rats as well as its effects on embryo-fetal development after maternal exposure during the entire pregnancy period. Amitraz was administered to pregnant rats by gavage from days 1 to 19 of gestation at dose levels of 0, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day. All dams underwent a caesarean section on day 20 of gestation and their fetuses were examined for any external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities. At 30 mg/kg, maternal toxicity manifested as an increase in the incidence of abnormal clinical signs and a lower body weight gain and food intake. Developmental toxicity included an increase in the fetal death rate, a decrease in the litter size, and a reduction in the fetal body weight. In addition, there was an increase in the incidence of fetal external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities. At 10 mg/kg, maternal toxicity observed included a decrease in the body weight gain and a decrease in food intake. In addition, minimal developmental toxicity, including a decrease in the fetal body weight, an increase in the visceral and skeletal aberrations, and a delay in fetal ossification. There were no signs of either maternal toxicity or developmental toxicity at 3 mg/kg. These results show that amitraz administered during the entire pregnancy period in rats is embryotoxic and teratogenic at the maternally toxic dose (i.e., 30 mg/kg/day) and is minimally embryotoxic at a minimally maternally toxic dose (i.e., 10 mg/kg/day). Under these experimental conditions, the no-observed-adverse-effect level of amitraz for both dams and embryo-fetal development is estimated to be 3 mg/kg/day.
Ecotoxicity monitoring of hydrocarbon-contaminated soil during bioremediation: a case study.	The ecotoxicity of hydrocarbon-contaminated soil originating from a brownfield site was evaluated during a 17-month biodegradation pilot test. The initial concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) in the soil was 6380 microg/g dry weight. An amount of 200 kg soil was inoculated with 1.5 L of the bacterial preparation GEM-100 containing Pseudomonas sp. and Acinetobacter sp. strains (5.3 x 10(10) CFU.mL(-1)) adapted to diesel fuel. The concentration of TPHs in the soil decreased by 65.5% after bioremediation. Different organisms such as the bacterium Vibrio fischeri, terrestrial plants Sinapis alba, Lactuca sativa, and Hordeum vulgare, the water plant Lemna minor, the earthworm Eisenia fetida, and the crustacean Heterocypris incongruens were used for ecotoxicity evaluation. The highest toxicity was detected in the first period of bioremediation. However, certain toxic effects were detectable during the whole bioremediation process. The contact tests with plants, earthworms, and crustaceans were the most sensitive of all of the bioassays. Therefore, the contact tests performed directly on soil samples were shown to be a better tool for ecotoxicity evaluation of hydrocarbon-contaminated soil than the tests performed on soil elutriates. The ecotoxicity measured by the responses of the tests did not always correlate with the decrease in TPH concentrations in the soil during bioremediation.
Laboratory investigation of the toxicity and interaction of pesticide mixtures in Daphnia magna.	The probabilistic ecological risk assessment-toxic equivalent (PERA-TE) combination approach is a relatively new risk assessment approach used to assess the toxicity and interaction of chemical mixtures. The validity and effectiveness of the PERA-TE combination approach has been tested previously in field microcosm studies using pesticide mixtures. The related laboratory studies described here, using Daphnia magna, were conducted to verify the conclusions made regarding the toxicity and interaction of the mixtures tested in the microcosms. Two types of pesticide mixture were assessed: the first consisted of pesticides with similar modes of action (chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and azinphos-methyl; OP mixture), and the second consisted of pesticides with different modes of action (chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and trifluralin; CET mixture). Similar to the field studies, PERA-TE mixtures with a predetermined effect assessment criterion (10th centile of acute toxicity effects distributions) and proportional ratio (89:11 for binary mixture and 80:10:10 for ternary mixtures) were tested. Further assessment of the (PERA-) TE approach was achieved by altering the effect assessment criterion (to EC/LC(50) point estimates) and the proportional ratio of the pesticides in the mixture (to 50:25:25). Generally, but with some exceptions, basing mixtures on species-specific effect criteria and/or changing the proportional ratio of pesticides in the mixture redistributed the concentration of pesticides in the mixture to produce an equitoxic response. The ability to produce these equitoxic responses supported the conclusions drawn from the field studies: The pesticide toxicity in the OP and CET PERA-TE mixtures were effectively additive. Furthermore, it is shown that these alternative (PERA-) TE mixtures would be suitable to confirm or reject the interaction of chemicals in a PERA-TE mixture.
Horizontal diffusion elutriation: a new size-separation technique for preparation of rodent-respirable fibers for animal testing.	Short-and long-term animal experiments are used to examine the toxicology and biopersistence of various types of fibers. In order to ensure an adequate exposure dose for testing, modern experimental protocols specify that the exposure aerosol (in an inhalation test) or the fibers (in an intratracheal instillation [IT] test) must contain at least a minimum concentration of long (> 20 mum) rodent-respirable fibers. As produced and handled, most fibers contain a distribution of diameters and lengths, only some of which are both long and rodent-respirable. Therefore, it is necessary to size-separate the fibers to enrich the proportion of long, rodent-respirable fibers in the material to be tested. This article presents a new and relatively simple method for size separation that avoids some of the difficulties associated with other methods. The method, termed horizontal diffusion elutriation (HDE), is illustrated by size-separating refractory ceramic fiber (RCF) and four polycrystalline alumina (PCA) fibers.
Woodsmoke health effects: a review.	The sentiment that woodsmoke, being a natural substance, must be benign to humans is still sometimes heard. It is now well established, however, that wood-burning stoves and fireplaces as well as wildland and agricultural fires emit significant quantities of known health-damaging pollutants, including several carcinogenic compounds. Two of the principal gaseous pollutants in woodsmoke, CO and NOx, add to the atmospheric levels of these regulated gases emitted by other combustion sources. Health impacts of exposures to these gases and some of the other woodsmoke constituents (e.g., benzene) are well characterized in thousands of publications. As these gases are indistinguishable no matter where they come from, there is no urgent need to examine their particular health implications in woodsmoke. With this as the backdrop, this review approaches the issue of why woodsmoke may be a special case requiring separate health evaluation through two questions. The first question we address is whether woodsmoke should be regulated and/or managed separately, even though some of its separate constituents are already regulated in many jurisdictions. The second question we address is whether woodsmoke particles pose different levels of risk than other ambient particles of similar size. To address these two key questions, we examine several topics: the chemical and physical nature of woodsmoke; the exposures and epidemiology of smoke from wildland fires and agricultural burning, and related controlled human laboratory exposures to biomass smoke; the epidemiology of outdoor and indoor woodsmoke exposures from residential woodburning in developed countries; and the toxicology of woodsmoke, based on animal exposures and laboratory tests. In addition, a short summary of the exposures and health effects of biomass smoke in developing countries is provided as an additional line of evidence. In the concluding section, we return to the two key issues above to summarize (1) what is currently known about the health effects of inhaled woodsmoke at exposure levels experienced in developed countries, and (2) whether there exists sufficient reason to believe that woodsmoke particles are sufficiently different to warrant separate treatment from other regulated particles. In addition, we provide recommendations for additional woodsmoke research.
Chlorpromazine and apigenin reduce adenovirus replication and decrease replication associated toxicity.	Adenoviruses can cause severe toxicity in immunocompromised individuals. Although clinical trials have confirmed the potency and safety of selectively oncolytic adenoviruses for treatment of advanced cancers, increasingly effective agents could result in more toxicity and therefore it would be useful if replication could be abrogated if necessary.
An oxidative stress-specific bacterial cell array chip for toxicity analysis.	An oxidative stress-specific bacterial cell array chip was fabricated and implemented in the analysis of various different chemicals. The chip consisted of twelve toxicity responsive strains that respond specifically to different oxidative toxicities such as the generation of the superoxide radical, except for strain EBMalK, which was included as a negative control. Each bioluminescent strain carried a fusion of a stress gene promoter (sodA, pqi-5, soxR, fumC, soxS, inaA, hmp, malK, katG, zwf, fpr or pgi) to the bacterial lux reporter genes. A total of nine chemicals were selected to exhibit the capabilities of this array when analyzing different oxidative toxicities. Each of the chemicals were categorized according to their structure and their ability to form radicals in vivo: (I) paraquat, an active radical producer, (II) structural analogs of paraquat that produce radicals, (III) chemicals that are distinct from paraquat but still produce radicals and (IV) chemicals having similar structures as paraquat but do not produce radicals. The results found that each strain was responsive to one or more of the compounds tested but, as a definitive factor, the responses from the chip were dependent upon the production of radicals, i.e., the strains were unresponsive to compounds that were similar in structure to paraquat but lacked the ability to generate radicals. The specificity of the strains used in the chip was also demonstrated by their ability to discriminate between the superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, this cell array chip could be implemented in characterizing and understanding the toxic impacts of newly synthesized chemicals and drugs in terms of toxicity classification and the nature of oxidative damage experienced by cells.
Effect of malathion on survival, growth, and food consumption of Indian cricket frog (Limnonectus limnocharis) tadpoles.	The effects of short-term exposure (28 days) of free-feeding Limnonectus limnocharis (Indian cricket frog) tadpoles to field concentrations of malathion were investigated. This frog species is a major biotic component of the agroecosystems of the Western Ghats (13 degrees 18', 75 degrees 25' and 13 degrees 22', 75 degrees 28'), where malathion (diethyl [(dimethoxy phosphino thioyl] butanediote), an organophosphate pesticide, is being used extensively. Although malathion is known to cause nonreversible acetylcholine inhibition and diminishes activity, growth and development in amphibian tadpoles, such data on Indian amphibian species are lacking. In the present study, increments in the following were used to assess such an impact: tadpole growth; increase in total length, body length, tail length, and body weight; and food consumption. The different concentrations of malathion employed were 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000 mug L(-1). Malathion exposure produced significant effects on all measured parameters. Tadpole survival decreased from 20 to 6 tadpoles, with an increase in concentration followed by a decrease in growth. Food consumption of surviving tadpoles also decreased (0.067 mg.g(-1).d(-1) to 0.0075 mg.g(-1).d(-1)) with increased malathion. Decreased food consumption, growth, and development of L. limnocharis tadpoles with an increase of malathion concentration (within field concentration range) over temporal scale reveal the possible threat to this species in the agroecosystems of the Western Ghats.
Screening of xenobiotics for direct immunotoxicity in an animal study.	It has now been recognised that the immune system as a whole can be the target for xenobiotic induced toxicity. The discipline of immuntoxicology encompasses non specific direct immunotoxicity and immunostimulation, and specific responses like hypersensitivity and autoimmunity. Direct immunotoxicity can be determined in tiered studies, TIER 1 being a general toxicity study with emphasis on evaluation of organs belonging to the immune system, TIER 2 investigating the effects of xenobiotics on immune functionality in immunological challenge experiments. In the TIER 1 study, organ weights and histopathological evaluation of immune organs like spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, blood and bone marrow may detect the occurrence of direct immunotoxicity. The follow up studies in the TIER 2 phase can then determine the extent of the immunosuppression and identify which specific parts or cellular components of the immune system are involved. In view of the complexity of the immune system and the multitude of interactions within the immune system in vivo animal experiments are needed to investigate xenobiotics for their potential immunotoxicity. In vitro assays with in vivo exposed cells of the immune system may present additional information on the mechanisms involved in the observed direct immunotoxicity.
Use of SRBC antibody responses for immunotoxicity testing.	The production of antigen-specific antibodies represents a major defense mechanism of humoral immune responses and involves the cooperation and interaction of several immune cell types: antigen presenting cells, T helper cells, and B cells. Thus, there are several cells or cell products (e.g., interleukins) that may be altered following xenobiotic exposure, making assays that evaluate the production of antigen specific antibody a relatively comprehensive and sensitive assessment of immune function. Data suggest that the primary antibody response to SRBC may be one of the most sensitive endpoints available to assess chemical-induced alterations to the immune system. As a result, this endpoint has become the cornerstone of several recently established guidelines for assessing the potential immunotoxicity of xenobiotics. Five types of antibody may be produced in a humoral immune response (i.e., IgGs of various subtypes, IgM, IgD, IgA, or IgE). For immunotoxicity assessment, the focus has primarily been on assays that assess production of IgM antibodies. Although a number of assays have been developed to evaluate antibody production, the antibody forming cell (AFC) assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are the two most frequently employed to evaluate the potential immunotoxicity of a xenobiotic. In this manuscript, background information, as well as the pros and cons of each of these assays are discussed and detailed methods on conducting each assay are provided.
Guinea pigs in hypersensitivity testing.	The aim of the present paper is to mention steps of development of predictive guinea pig animal models for contact sensitization evaluation in parallel with the development of understanding the mechanism of contact sensitization. The guinea pigs methods are reviewed and the presently accepted methods (Buehler test, Maximization test) are discussed in details. Influences on the outcome of guinea pig sensitization assays are mentioned too. The predictability of the guinea pig methods is compared with predictive methods in mice, with human tests (human repeated insult patch test, HRIPT) and epidemiological data. In the last part, a testing strategy and steps for risk assessment of contact sensitizing potential is proposed.
Animal models to test respiratory allergy of low molecular weight chemicals: a guidance.	At present, there are no widely applied or fully validated test methods to identify respiratory LMW allergens, i.e. compounds that are considered capable of inducing allergic asthma. Most tests have been investigated using strong respiratory allergens. Moreover, they are meant to detect the potential of a chemical to induce respiratory sensitisation at relatively high doses. Consequently, the sensitivity of the tests is not well-known, and they do not provide information on low doses such as generally found in occupational situations, and on threshold levels to be used in risk assessment. In addition, the various test methods use different application routes, i.e. intradermal, topical or inhalation exposure, and different parameters. Therefore standardised and validated dose-response test methods are urgently required in order to be able to identify respiratory allergens and to recommend safe exposure levels for consumers and workers. In the present paper, methods or testing strategies are described to detect respiratory sensitisation and/or allergy. Overall, assays that utilize only an induction phase may serve as indicators of respiratory sensitisation potential whereas assays that use both an induction and an elicitation or challenge phase may provide information on potency and presence of thresholds. The dermal route as sensitisation route has the advantage of the respiratory tract not being exposed to the allergen prior to challenge which facilitates the distinction between irritant and allergic effects.
Methodologies for developmental immunotoxicity (DIT) testing.	Developmental immunotoxicity has gained increasing recognition as a significant factor influencing the risk of later life disease. Based on the data collected thus far on different chemicals and drugs, the developing immune system can be significantly more sensitive than the adult immune system to xenobiotic-induced insult. There are distinct differences between the immune system surrounding birth and that in the mature adult as well as differences in the nature of immunotoxic changes based on age. Immunosuppresssion is not the only concern. Immunotoxic changes that increase the risk for allergic or autoimmune responses should also be considered. Therefore, one should not assume that immunotoxicity assays validated for adult exposure assessment are inherently the most predictive for developmental immunotoxicology (DIT) evaluation. Many of those adult-based protocols were developed solely to detect immunosuppression, whereas DIT concerns include shifts in immune balance. For this reason, it is useful to examine the various immune endpoints that have been employed in recent perinatal immunotoxicity studies, compare those against routine adult immunotoxicity evaluation protocols, and consider the options that are available for effective DIT testing. The results published on several chemicals and drugs in recent years suggest that functional tests are a front-line priority for perinatal immunotoxicity detection and that a combination of at least two functional tests (such as a multi-isotype T-dependent antibody response (TDARs), and a cell-mediated immune response assay such as the delayed-type hypersensitivity assay and/or T cell or NK cytotoxicity assays) should be paired with immune cell populations and histopathological analysis. Cytokine production measurements offer outstanding promise and may eventually be able to be substituted for other more laborious procedures. However, multi-cytokine analysis needs to be standardized in terms of optimum source for analysis and protocol.
Special-purpose fiber type 475--toxicological assessment.	Type 475 special-purpose glass fiber is rather unique among the family of synthetic mineral fibers. It is used not for insulation but for "high-end" filtration products designed for high and ultra-high purity filtration of air and liquids. The designation for these types of filters varies with country and includes HEPA, ULPA, EU 10-13, EN1822, and S3. In its evaluation, type 475 has been grouped together with E-glass another special-purpose fibre often with little distinction made in terms of its chemistry and corresponding toxicological response. The detailed review of the available toxicology data on type 475 glass fibers clearly shows that following inhalation of this fiber even at relatively high doses, which likely exceed that at which lung overload in the rat is known to occur, type 475 glass fibers are not fibrogenic and do not cause tumors. These data clearly show an important differentiation in potency between type 475 glass fibers and E-glass and support treating these two types of fibers independently and not equating them though the term "special-purpose fibers." Analysis of the intraperitoneal studies taking into account fibre dimensions shows that at 109 fibers injected, there was a 0.3 tumor incidence. While these studies indicate according to the European Commission (EC) classification criteria that 475 should not be fully exonerated as a carcinogen, the results of the inhalation study fully support classification in category 3. The IP results are more difficult to interpret, however, the IP study itself provides no toxicological basis for determining what range of dose-response should correspond to EU category 3 or 2. Following the EC classification criteria, the toxicological data clearly indicate that 475 fibers are appropriately classified in EC category 3.
Performance of potential non-crop or wild species under OECD 208 testing guideline study conditions for terrestrial non-target plants.	The inclusion of 52 potential non-crop or wild species in new OECD guidelines for terrestrial non-target plant (TNTP) testing led to a ring test conducted by four laboratories experienced in regulatory testing. Species selected had shown potential to meet validity criteria of emergence for TNTP studies in a previous evaluation of the 52 species. OECD 208 guideline conditions were applied, with and without seed pretreatments recommended to enhance germination. These species were Abutilon theophrasti (L.) Medic., Avena fatua L., Fallopia convolvulus (L.) Adans., Galium aparine L., Ipomoea hederacea (L.) Jacq. and Veronica persica Poir. Only I. hederacea met the validity criterion of 70% emergence in all laboratories and showed a low variability in biomass. Of the other species, none led to 70% emergence in all four laboratories. The recommended pretreatments did not have a major impact on emergence. Biomass was also investigated with A. theophrasti, A. fatua, Centaurea cyanus L., I. hederacea and Rumex crispus L. Variability of biomass, a key parameter in TNTP regulatory studies, exceeded normal biomass variability of crop species used for TNTP studies. The addition of a thin layer of quartz sand to the soil surface resulted in improved emergence of C. cyanus, G. aparine and V. persica; however, such a procedure, while routine in screening studies to improve germination, is a deviation from the TNTP guidelines. These initial studies indicate that some species could meet the emergence criteria for TNTP testing. However, there is a need for further studies on seed source, seed quality and conditions for uniform emergence before their use in routine regulatory testing.
Toxicological study on Glinus lotoides: a traditionally used taenicidal herb in Ethiopia.	Seeds of Glinus lotoides L. (Molluginaceae) are used traditionally in the treatment of tapeworm infestation in Ethiopia. Previous studies on its anthelmintic activities confirmed its traditional claims, but data on safety profile were lacking. To this effect, single and repeated dose oral toxicities of the methanolic extracts of seeds of Glinus lotoides were conducted in rats. Doses of 0, 1000 and 5000 mg/kg of crude extract of Glinus lotoides were employed in single dose toxicity studies, while doses of 0, 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg were used in repeated toxicity studies. In the single dose toxicity test, oral administration of 5000 mg/kg of Glinus lotoides produced mortality in two females and one male on day 4. No significant differences in body and organ weights were observed between controls and treated surviving animals. Moreover, both gross and microscopic examinations of organs did not show detectable differences between controls and treated animals of both sexes. In repeated dose toxicity studies, no mortality was observed when varying doses of the extracts were administered per day for a period of 28 days. There were no significant differences in body weight, absolute and relative organ weights between controls and treated animals of both sexes. Hematological analysis showed no differences in most parameters examined. In the biochemistry parameter analysis, no significant change occurred. Pathologically, neither gross abnormalities nor histopathological changes were observed. These finding suggest that none of the organs appeared to be target and the data could provide satisfactory preclinical evidence of safety to launch clinical trial on standardized formulation of plant extracts.
Effects of cyanobacterial biomass on the Japanese quail.	Mortality of wild aquatic birds has recently been attributed to cyanobacterial toxins. Despite this, no experimental studies on the effects of defined doses of microcystins administered orally to birds exist. In this experiment, four groups of male Japanese quails daily ingesting 10ml of Microcystis biomass containing 0.045, 0.459, 4.605 or 46.044mug of microcystins, respectively, for 10 and 30 days, showed no mortality. Histopathological hepatic changes in birds after the biomass exposure included cloudy swelling of hepatocytes, vacuolar dystrophy, steatosis and hyperplasia of lymphatic centres. On subcellular level, shrunken nuclei of hepatocytes containing ring-like nucleoli, cristolysis within mitochondria and vacuoles with pseudomyelin structures were present. Vacuolar degeneration of the testicular germinative epithelium was found in two exposed males. Statistically significant differences in biochemical parameters were on day 10 of exposure only. They comprised increased activities of lactate dehydrogenase and a drop in blood glucose in birds receiving the highest dose of the biomass. Principal component analysis revealed a pattern of responses in biochemical parameters on day 10 that clearly separated the two greatest exposure groups from the controls and lower exposures. The results indicate that diagnosis of microcystin intoxication solely based on clinical biochemical and haematological parameters is hardly possible in birds.
Dose-response relationships and statistical performance of a battery of bacterial gene profiling assays.	Because of increasing awareness and legislative demands, there is a demand for the development and use of biological assays for the assessment of the toxicity of chemicals, environmental samples. Recently, a growing number of bacterial reporter assays have been developed and implemented. Nevertheless, little data is published on the performance of these assays in terms of analytical parameters. We present results on a battery of 14 transgenic Escherichia coli strains carrying different promoter::reporter fusions. Growth characteristics and basal expression levels were modeled and fitted, data show that growth curves should be taken into account during test development. Our study shows that the induction profiles reflect the mode of action, e.g., paraquat clearly induces the soxRS operon. The sensitivity of the assay compares well to that of whole organism tests, e.g., fish and Daphnia for polar organics. Metal toxicity is detected less efficiently, e.g., cadmium is detected near the LC50 of carp, considered a relatively insensitive species towards cadmium. The assay variability ranges from 10 to 40% depending on the strain, comparable to that of other bioassays. The variability was shown to be determined by the intrinsic traits of the promoter-strain combination, not by operating conditions.
Toxicity assessment for the horseshoe crab Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda collected from Cambodia.	In this study, we assessed the toxicity of the horseshoe crab Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda collected from Cambodia within two successive months during rainy (April-May) and dry (December-January) seasons, respectively. Toxicity assessments of the collected specimens by standard mouse bioassay showed marked individual variation, and their toxin profiles by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) revealed tetrodotoxin (TTX) was the main toxin while no paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) were detected. All specimens were toxic and the highest toxicity values were 315, 113, 60, 47, 44 and 38 mouse units (MU)/g in the tissues of hepatic caecum, egg, viscera, muscle, intestine and testis, respectively. Although the current findings showed that the Cambodian C. rotundicauda was a moderately toxic species, they are not suitable for human consumption due to their toxicity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scientific study on toxic marine seafood ever investigated in Cambodian territorial waters.
Cytotoxic effects of aggregated nanomaterials.	This study deals with cytotoxicity assays performed on an array of commercially manufactured inorganic nanoparticulate materials, including Ag, TiO(2), Fe(2)O(3), Al(2)O(3), ZrO(2), Si(3)N(4), naturally occurring mineral chrysotile asbestos and carbonaceous nanoparticulate materials such as multiwall carbon nanotube aggregates and black carbon aggregates. The nanomaterials were characterized by TEM, as the primary particles, aggregates or long fiber dimensions ranged from 2nm to 20microm. Cytotoxicological assays of these nanomaterials were performed utilizing a murine alveolar macrophage cell line and human macrophage and epithelial lung cell lines as comparators. The nanoparticulate materials exhibited varying degrees of cytoxicity for all cell lines and the general trends were similar for both the murine and human macrophage cell lines. These findings suggest that representative cytotoxic responses for humans might be obtained by nanoparticulate exposures to simple murine macrophage cell line assays. Moreover, these results illustrate the utility in performing rapid in vitro assays for cytotoxicity assessments of nanoparticulate materials as a general inquiry of potential respiratory health risks in humans.
Local and systemic pathophysiological alterations induced by a serine proteinase from the venom of the snake Bothrops jararacussu.	The local and systemic pathophysiological alterations induced by BjussuSP-I, a thrombin-like serine proteinase from the venom of the snake Bothrops jararacussu, were assessed in mice. BjussuSP-I induced a mild edema but no local myonecrosis or hemorrhage. It did not induce any microvascular alteration in the cremaster muscle. Intramuscular injection of BjussuSP-I promoted an increase in the expression of proMMP-9, but it did not induce the activation of proMMP-2 or proMMP-9 synthesized in muscle tissue injected with a myotoxic phospholipase A(2) homolog. BjussuSP-I induced defibrin(ogen)ation upon intravenous and intramuscular injections, with reduction in plasma fibrinogen concentration and increments in the levels of fibrin degradation products and D-dimer. When compared with animals having normal coagulation, mice defibrin(ogen)ated by BjussuSP-I developed a slightly larger hemorrhagic lesion in the skin when injected with metalloproteinase BaP1. Intravenous injection of sublethal doses of BjussuSP-I promoted a series of behavioral and motor changes similar to those previously described for 'gyroxin', i.e. opisthotonus and a circular body movement along the longitudinal axis.
Quantitative proteomic analysis of rat liver for carcinogenicity prediction in a 28-day repeated dose study.	The potential of quantitative proteomic analysis to predict carcinogenicity of chemical compounds was investigated. Using 2D-DIGE, we analyzed the effects of 63 chemical compounds on protein expression in the rat liver after 28 daily doses. Types of carcinogens were categorized depending on the species and organ specificity. The carcinogen characteristic proteins for each classification were identified by Welch's t value. For evaluation of the predictive concordance we used support vector machines. The rat hepatic carcinogen-specific classification gave higher concordance than the other classification. The generalization performance was measured by leave-one-out cross-validation. For genotoxic and non-genotoxic compounds, a concordance of 79.3 and 76.5%, respectively, was obtained by the top 30 ranked proteins with Welch's t value. Furthermore, we found that the increase of the expression level of the stress response proteins as the common feature of poorly predicted chemical compounds in the leave-20%-out cross-validation. Quantitative proteomics could be promising technique for developing biomarker panels that can be used for carcinogenicity prediction. The list of proteins identified in this study and the zoomed gel images of the top ranked proteins in statistic analysis are provided in Supplementary Data.
A toxicity evaluation and predictive system based on neural networks and wavelets.	A computational approach has been developed for performing efficient and reasonably accurate toxicity evaluation and prediction. The approach is based on computational neural networks linked to modern computational chemistry and wavelet methods. In this paper, we present details of this approach and results demonstrating its accuracy and flexibility for predicting diverse biological endpoints including metabolic processes, mode of action, and hepato- and neurotoxicity. The approach also can be used for automatic processing of microarray data to predict modes of action.
Low-temperature anaerobic biological treatment of toluene-containing wastewater.	Two expanded granular sludge bed-anaerobic filter (EGSB-AF) bioreactors, R1 and R2, were operated at 15 degrees C for the treatment of toluene-contaminated volatile fatty acid-based wastewater. The seed inoculum and the R1 reactor were unexposed to toluene, prior to and during the trial, respectively. Both reactors were operated at a hydraulic retention time of 24h at applied organic loading rates of 0.71-1.43kg chemical oxygen demand (COD)m(-3)d(-1). Toluene was supplemented to the R2 influent at concentrations of 5-104 mg toluenel(-1) (solubilised in ethanol). Bioreactor performance was evaluated by COD and toluene removal efficiency, and the methane content of biogas (%). Specific methanogenic activity and toxicity assays were employed to investigate the activity and toluene toxicity thresholds of key trophic groups, respectively, within the seed and reactor biomass samples. COD and toluene removal efficiencies of 70-90% and 55-99%, respectively, were achieved during the 630-d trial. Metabolic assays suggested that a psychrotolerant H(2)/CO(2)-utilizing methanogenic community developed in the toluene-degrading biomass. The results indicate the viability of low-temperature anaerobic digestion for the treatment of wastewater containing toluene.
Toxicity and feeding deterrence of crude toxin extracts of Lecanicillium (Verticillium) lecanii (Hyphomycetes) against sweet potato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae).	Crude toxins [toxin(V3450) and toxin(Vp28,) extracted from Lecanicillium (Verticillium) lecanii (Zimmermann) Gams & Zare strain V3450 and Vp28 respectively] were tested for contact toxicity, feeding deterrence and repellent activity against the sweet potato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae). Both toxins showed ovicidal activity to eggs, with LC(50) values of 447 and 629 mg L(-1) respectively. Nymphs of B. tabaci were the most susceptible stages (LC(50) values were calculated at 111 mg L(-1) for toxin(V3450) and 216 mg L(-1) for toxin(Vp28)), and adults were the second most susceptible stages (48 h LC(50) values were calculated at 178 mg L(-1) for toxin(V3450) and 438 mg L(-1) for toxin(Vp28)). Applied to seedlings at a concentration of 400 mg L(-1), the toxins significantly (P < 0.001) reduced the hatching of whitefly eggs and the subsequent survival rate of the nymphs, and the emergence and fecundity of the progeny adults. Both toxins exhibited repellent activity at low concentration (100 mg L(-1)), with repellency index (RI) values of 0.645 for toxin(V3450) and 0.642 for toxin(Vp28), and antifeedant activity at high concentration (1000 mg L(-1)) to adults, with antifeedant index (AFI) values of 0.713 for toxin(V3450) and 0.749 for toxin(Vp28). The results of the present study demonstrate the toxicity, repellence and antifeedant properties of the fungi metabolite toxins on B. tabaci, which might develop as environmentally friendly plant protectant(s).
Venomic analyses of Scolopendra viridicornis nigra and Scolopendra angulata (Centipede, Scolopendromorpha): shedding light on venoms from a neglected group.	Centipedes are venomous arthropods responsible for a significant number of non-lethal human envenomations. Despite this, information about the composition and function of their venom contents is scarce. In this study, we have used a 'structure to function' proteomic approach combining two-dimensional chromatography (2D-LC), electrospray ionization quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-Q-TOF/MS), N-terminal sequencing and similarity searching to better understand the complexities of the venoms from two Brazilian centipede species: Scolopendra viridicornis nigra and Scolopendra angulata. Comparisons between the LC profiles and the mass compositions of the venoms of the two species are provided. The observed molecular masses ranged from 3019.62 to 20996.94Da in S. viridicornis nigra (total: 62 molecular masses) and from 1304.73 to 22639.15Da in S. angulata (total: 65 molecular masses). Also, the N-termini of representatives of 10 protein/peptide families were successfully sequenced where nine of them showed no significant similarity to other protein sequences deposited in the Swiss-Prot database. A screening for insecto-toxic activities in fractions from S. viridicornis venom has also been performed. Six out of the 12 tested fractions were responsible for clear toxic effects in house flies. This work demonstrates that centipede venoms might be a neglected but important source of new bioactive compounds.
Analysis of the inflammatory reaction induced by the catfish (Cathorops spixii) venoms.	Cathorops spixii is one of the most abundant venomous fish of the southeastern coast of the State of São Paulo, and consequently causes a great part of the accidents seen there. The accidents affect mainly fishermen, swimmers and tourists and are characterized by punctiform or wide wounds, erythema, edema, pain, sudoresis, indisposition, fever, nausea, vomiting and secondary infection. The objective of this work was to characterize the inflammatory response induced in mice by both venoms (mucus and sting) of the catfish C. spixii. Our results demonstrated that both venoms induced a great number of rolling and adherent leukocytes in the post-capillary venules of cremaster muscle of mice, and an increase in the vascular permeability in peritoneal cavity. Mucus induced the recruitment of neutrophils immediately after injection followed later by macrophage infiltration. In contrast, the cellular infiltration elicited by sting venom was rapidly resolved. The peritonitis reaction provoked by venoms was characterized by cytokine (IL-6), chemokines (MCP-1 and KC) or lipid mediator (LTB4) production in the peritoneal cavity. The macrophages from 7-day mucus venom-induced exudates upon in vitro mucus venom stimulation, expressed CD11c x MHC class II and release bioactive IL-12p70. On the other hand, sting venom-elicited peritoneal macrophages lost the ability to differentiate into dendritic cells, following re-stimulation in vitro with sting venom, they do not express CD11c, nor do they exhibit sufficient levels of MHC class II. In conclusion, both types of venoms (mucus or sting) promote inflammatory reaction with different profiles, and the inflammatory reaction induced by the first was characterized by antigen persistence in peritoneal cavity that allowed the activation of phagocytic cells with capacity of antigenic presentation.
Toxicological evaluation of genetically modified cotton (Bollgard) and Dipel WP on the non-target soil mite Scheloribates praeincisus (Acari: Oribatida).	Insecticides derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and plants genetically modified (GM) to express B. thuringiensis toxins are important alternatives for insect pest control worldwide. Risk assessment of B. thuringiensis toxins to non-target organisms has been extensively studied but few toxicological tests have considered soil invertebrates. Oribatid mites are one of the most diverse and abundant arthropod groups in the upper layers of soil and litter in natural and agricultural systems. These mites are exposed to the toxic compounds of GM crops or pesticides mainly when they feed on vegetal products incorporated in the soil. Although some effects of B. thuringiensis products on Acari have been reported, effects on oribatid mites are still unknown. This study investigated the effects of the ingestion of Bt cotton Bollgard and of the B. thuringiensis commercial product Dipel WP on the pantropical species Scheloribates praeincisus (Scheloribatidae). Ingestion of Bollgard and Dipel did not affect adult and immature survivorship and food consumption (estimated by number of fecal pellets produced daily) or developmental time of immature stages of S. praeincisus. These results indicate the safety of Bollgard and Dipel to S. praeincisus under field conditions where exposition is lower and other food sources besides leaves of Bt plants are available. The method for toxicological tests described here can be adapted to other species of Oribatida, consisting on a new option to risk assessment studies.
The impact of the goitrogen 6-propylthiouracil (PTU) on West-African clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis) exposed during metamorphosis.	This study investigated the suitability of using tadpoles of the West-African clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis) for studying adverse effects on the thyroid hormone system after chemical exposure. Tadpoles were exposed to the thyroxine synthesis inhibitor 6-propylthiouracil (PTU) at concentrations between 2-75mg/L during 14 days. After 5 and 14 days of exposure the developmental stage, hind limb length, body length and weight were measured. Moreover, histological measurements of the thyroid glands were performed after 14 days of exposure. These measurements included maximum thyroid cross-section area, follicular area and epithelial cell height. Tadpoles in the 75mg/L treatment were less developed and had shorter hind limb length than the control group after 14 days of exposure. No effects were recorded on these parameters at lower PTU concentrations. The histological measurements revealed clear dose-response relationships in both follicular cross-section area and epithelial cell height, with lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) recorded at 2 and 5mg/L, respectively. This study shows that X. tropicalis is a suitable species for detection of thyroid disrupting chemicals. Further, histopathological measurements of thyroid glands are more sensitive parameters compared with apical endpoints when studying adverse effects on thyroid hormone system caused by PTU exposure in X. tropicalis.
Pyramiding of insecticidal compounds for control of the cowpea bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus F.).	The cowpea bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus F.) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchini) is a major pest of stored cowpea grain. With limited available technologies for controlling the bruchid, transgenic cowpeas with bruchid resistance genes engineered into them could become the next management tools. An investigation was made of two different sets of potential transgenic insecticidal compounds using an artificial seed system: (i) CIP-PH-BT-J and recombinant egg white avidin, and (ii) avidin and wheat alpha-amylase inhibitor. CIP-PH-BT-J (0.1%; 1000 mg kg(-1)) and recombinant egg white avidin (0.006%; 60 mg kg(-1)) incorporated separately into artificial seeds caused 98.2 and 99% larval mortality rates respectively. Combining CIP-PH-BT-J and avidin in the same artificial seed provided additional mortality compared with each factor incorporated singly; no insects survived in seeds with the combined toxins. Similarly, when avidin and wheat alpha-amylase inhibitor (alphaAI) (1%; 10 g kg(-1)) were incorporated separately into artificial seeds, this caused 99.8 and 98% mortality respectively. However, in combination, avidin and alphaAI did not increase mortality, but they did cause a significant increase in developmental time of the cowpea bruchids. These results emphasize that the joint action of potential insecticidal compounds cannot be predicted from results obtained separately for each compound, and they suggest potential transgenes for further consideration.
On the mechanism of action and selectivity of the corn herbicide topramezone: a new inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase.	Topramezone is a new, highly selective herbicide of pyrazole structure for the post-emergence control of broadleaf and grass weeds in corn. The biokinetic properties and mode of action of topramezone were investigated in plants of Setaria faberi Herrm, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, Solanum nigrum L. and the crop species corn (Zea mays L.). Within 2-5 days after treatment, topramezone caused strong photobleaching effects on the shoot, followed by plant death of sensitive weeds. The selectivity of topramezone between corn and the weed species has been quantified as above 1000-fold. By virtue of the plant symptoms and the reversal of the effects in Lemna paucicostata L. by adding homogentisate, it was hypothesized that topramezone blocks the formation of homogentisate, possibly through inhibition of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (4-HPPD). Indeed, topramezone strongly inhibited 4-HPPD activity in vitro, with I(50) values of 15 and 23 nM for the enzyme isolated from S. faberi and recombinant enzyme of Arabidopsis thaliana L. respectively. The enzyme activity from corn was approximately 10 times less sensitive. After root and foliar application of [(14)C]topramezone, equivalent to field rates of 75 g ha(-1), the herbicide was rapidly absorbed and systemically translocated in the plant. Only marginal differences between leaf uptake and translocation of topramezone by the weeds and corn were found. Metabolism of foliar-applied [(14)C]topramezone was far more rapid in corn than in the weeds. A more rapid metabolism combined with a lower sensitivity of the 4-HPPD target enzyme contributes to the tolerance of corn to topramezone.
Toxicity of venoms from vipers of Pelias group to crickets Gryllus assimilis and its relation to snake entomophagy.	The existing data indicate that snake venom is most toxic towards the natural vertebrate preys. Several species of snake include arthropods in their food. However, there is no available data on the toxicity of venom from entomophagous snakes towards their prey. We have studied the toxicity of venom from vipers of Pelias group towards crickets Gryllus assimilis. The Pelias group includes several closely related viper species inhabiting mainly the South European part of Russia, and they differ in their feeding preferences. Snakes from the Vipera renardi, Vipera lotievi, Vipera kaznakovi, and Vipera orlovi species feed on wide range of animals including insects, whereas snakes from Vipera berus and Vipera nikolskii species do not include insects in their diet. We have found that the venom from vipers that include insects in their diet possesses greater toxicity towards crickets. The greatest toxicity was observed for the venom from V. lotievi, which displays a preference for insects in its diet. Therefore, based on our data, we suggest that the viper entomophagy is not a result of behavior plasticity, but is probably determined at a genetic level.

Neuronal cell culture from human embryonic stem cells as in vitro model for neuroprotection.	In the context of efficacy testing of pharmacological compounds in animal models, replacement of some of these models with a relevant human in vitro system appears attractive, in particular with regard to large scale screening. Here, we show results from initial phases of a project, which attempts to explore the outstanding potential of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-based in vitro models with special regard to neuronal stress as a potential replacement of animal models for human neurodegenerative diseases. We show the functionality of neurons derived from hESC precursors by calcium imaging, mitochondrial potential measurements and Western blots and moreover demonstrate that this model reproduces crucial mechanistic aspects observed during ischemia and excitotoxicity that are thought to be at the core of some neurodegenerative diseases. Also, the broader possibilities for refining surrogate molecular information emerging from the detailed analysis of this model are discussed.
Synthesis and spectral study of molybdovanadophosphoric heteropoly compound containing glycine with tri-vanadium-substituted Dawson structure]	A new molybdovanadophosphoric heteropoly compound containing glycine with tri-vanadium-substituted Dawson structure, namely C2 H14O64P2Mo1515V3 x 5H2O was synthesized and structurally characterized by elemental analysis, including IR spectra, X-ray and TGA powder diffraction. The median lethal dose (LD50) was 3 798. 83 mg x kg(-1), and the range of 95% confidence limit was 2 976. 81-4 847. 85 mg x kg(-1). According to the study, this new compound may be regarded as a low toxic compound.
The 2005 World Health Organization re-evaluation of TEFs for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds--what are the consequences for German human background levels?	In 2005 the World Health Organization (WHO) re-evaluated toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds. WHO 2005 toxicity equivalent (TEq) levels were calculated based on our data on German background levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD), dibenzofurans (PCDF) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in human blood and milk of the Duisburg birth cohort study. Levels of WHO 2005 TEq (PCDD/F+PCB) were in the range of 3.77-63.6 pg/g(lipid base) (n=226, median: 19.38, arithmetic mean: 20.86) for blood, or 2.62-59.2 pg/g(lipid base) (n=176, median: 19.78, arithmetic mean: 20.57) for milk, respectively. Compared to WHO 1998 TEq values WHO 2005 TEq levels were about 25% lower in both matrices. The shares of PCB (31% blood, 43% milk), especially of mono-ortho-substituted PCB (4% blood and milk), on total WHO 2005 TEq has become lower. If similar congener patterns can be assumed for certain matrices, appropriate multiplication factors can be used to convert TEq values of other TEF models sufficiently to WHO 2005 TEq values.
Final report on the safety assessment of capsicum annuum extract, capsicum annuum fruit extract, capsicum annuum resin, capsicum annuum fruit powder, capsicum frutescens fruit, capsicum frutescens fruit extract, capsicum frutescens resin, and capsaicin.	Capsicum-derived ingredients function as skin-conditioning agents--miscellaneous, external analgesics, flavoring agents, or fragrance components in cosmetics. These ingredients are used in 19 cosmetic products at concentrations as high as 5%. Cosmetic-grade material may be extracted using hexane, ethanol, or vegetable oil and contain the full range of phytocompounds that are found in the Capsicum annuum or Capsicum frutescens plant (aka red chiles), including Capsaicin. Aflatoxin and N-nitroso compounds (N-nitrosodimethylamine and N-nitrosopyrrolidine) have been detected as contaminants. The ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectrum for Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract indicates a small peak at approximately 275 nm, and a gradual increase in absorbance, beginning at approximately 400 nm. Capsicum and paprika are generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in food. Hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate extracts of Capsicum Frutescens Fruit at 200 mg/kg resulted in death of all mice. In a short-term inhalation toxicity study using rats, no difference was found between vehicle control and a 7% Capsicum Oleoresin solution. In a 4-week feeding study, red chilli (Capsicum annuum) in the diet at concentrations up to 10% was relatively nontoxic in groups of male mice. In an 8-week feeding study using rats, intestinal exfoliation, cytoplasmic fatty vacuolation and centrilobular necrosis of hepatocytes, and aggregation of lymphocytes in the portal areas were seen at 10% Capsicum Frutescens Fruit, but not 2%. Rats fed 0.5 g/kg day-1 crude Capsicum Fruit Extract for 60 days exhibited no significant gross pathology at necropsy, but slight hyperemia of the liver and reddening of the gastric mucosa were observed. Weanling rats fed basal diets supplemented with whole red pepper at concentrations up to 5.0% for up to 8 weeks had no pathology of the large intestines, livers, and kidneys, but destruction of the taste buds and keratinization and erosion of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract were noted in groups fed 0.5% to 5.0% red pepper. The results of 9-and 12-month extension of this study showed normal large intestines and kidneys. In rabbits fed Capsicum Annuum Powder at 5 mg/kg day-1 in the diet daily for 12 months damage to the liver and spleen was noted. A rabbit skin irritation test of Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract at concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 1.0% produced no irritation, but Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract induced concentration-dependent (at 25 to 500 microg/ml) cytotoxicity in a human buccal mucosa fibroblast cell line. An ethanol extract of red chili was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA98, but not in TA100, or in Escherichia coli. Other genotoxicity assays gave a similar pattern of mixed results. Adenocarcinoma of the abdomen was observed in 7/20 mice fed 100 mg red chilies per day for 12 months; no tumors were seen in control animals. Neoplastic changes in the liver and intestinal tumors were observed in rats fed red chili powder at 80 mg/kg day-1 for 30 days, intestinal and colon tumors were seen in rats fed red chili powder and 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine, but no tumors were observed in controls. In another study in rats, however, red chile pepper in the diet at the same dose decreased the number of tumors seen with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. Other feeding studies evaluated the effect of red chili peppers on the incidence of stomach tumors produced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, finding that red pepper had a promoting effect. Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract promoted the carcinogenic effect of methyl(acetoxymethyl)nitrosamine (carcinogen) or benzene hexachloride (hepatocarcinogen) in inbred male and female Balb/c mice dosed orally (tongue application). Clinical findings include symptoms of cough, sneezing, and runny nose in chili factory workers. Human respiratory responses to Capsicum Oleoresin spray include burning of the throat, wheezing, dry cough, shortness of breath, gagging, gasping, inability to breathe or speak, and, rarely, cyanosis, apnea, and respiratory arrest. A trade name mixture containing 1% to 5% Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract induced very slight erythema in 1 of 10 volunteers patch tested for 48 h. Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract at 0.025% in a repeated-insult patch test using 103 subjects resulted in no clinically meaningful irritation or allergic contact dermatitis. One epidemiological study indicated that chili pepper consumption may be a strong risk factor for gastric cancer in populations with high intakes of chili pepper; however, other studies did not find this association. Capsaicin functions as an external analgesic, a fragrance ingredient, and as a skin-conditioning agent--miscellaneous in cosmetic products, but is not in current use. Capsaicin is not generally recognized as safe and effective by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for fever blister and cold sore treatment, but is considered to be safe and effective as an external analgesic counterirritant. Ingested Capsaicin is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine in animal studies. Subcutaneous injection of Capsaicin in rats resulted in a rise in the blood concentration, reaching a maximum at 5 h; the highest tissue concentrations were in the kidney and lowest in the liver. In vitro percutaneous absorption of Capsaicin has been demonstrated in human, rat, mouse, rabbit, and pig skin. Enhancement of the skin permeation of naproxen (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent) in the presence of Capsaicin has also been demonstrated. Pharmacological and physiological studies demonstrated that Capsaicin, which contains a vanillyl moiety, produces its sensory effects by activating a Ca2 +-permeable ion channel on sensory neurons. Capsaicin is a known activator of vanilloid receptor 1. Capsaicin-induced stimulation of prostaglandin biosynthesis has been shown using bull seminal vesicles and rheumatoid arthritis synoviocytes. Capsaicin inhibits protein synthesis in Vero kidney cells and human neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y cells in vitro, and inhibits growth of E. coli, Pseudomonas solanacearum, and Bacillus subtilis bacterial cultures, but not Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Oral LD50 values as low as 161.2 mg/kg (rats) and 118.8 mg/kg (mice) have been reported for Capsaicin in acute oral toxicity studies, with hemorrhage of the gastric fundus observed in some of the animals that died. Intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous LD50 values were lower. In subchronic oral toxicity studies using mice, Capsaicin produced statistically significant differences in the growth rate and liver/body weight increases. Capsaicin is an ocular irritant in mice, rats, and rabbits. Dose-related edema was observed in animals receiving Capsaicin injections into the hindpaw (rats) or application to the ear (mice). In guinea pigs, dinitrochlorobenzene contact dermatitis was enhanced in the presence of Capsaicin, injected subcutaneously, whereas dermal application inhibited sensitization in mice. Immune system effects have been observed in neonatal rats injected subcutaneously with Capsaicin. Capsaicin produced mixed results in S. typhimurium micronucleus and sister-chromatid exchange genotoxicity assays. Positive results for Capsaicin were reported in DNA damage assays. Carcinogenic, cocarcinogenic, anticarcinogenic, antitumorigenic, tumor promotion, and anti-tumor promotion effects of Capsaicin have been reported in animal studies. Except for a significant reduction in crown-rump length in day 18 rats injected subcutaneously with Capsaicin (50 mg/kg) on gestation days 14, 16, 18, or 20, no reproductive or developmental toxicity was noted. In pregnant mice dosed subcutaneously with Capsaicin, depletion of substance P in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves of pregnant females and fetuses was noted. In clinical tests, nerve degeneration of intracutaneous nerve fibers and a decrease in pain sensation induced by heat and mechanical stimuli were evident in subjects injected intradermally with Capsaicin. An increase in mean inspiratory flow was reported for eight normal subjects who inhaled nebulized 10(-7) M Capsaicin. The results of provocative and predictive tests involving human subjects indicated that Capsaicin is a skin irritant. Overall, studies suggested that these ingredients can be irritating at low concentrations. Although the genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and tumor promotion potential of Capsaicin have been demonstrated, so have opposite effects. Skin irritation and other tumor-promoting effects of Capsaicin appear to be mediated through interaction with the same vanilloid receptor. Given this mechanism of action and the observation that many tumor promoters are irritating to the skin, the Panel considered it likely that a potent tumor promoter may also be a moderate to severe skin irritant. Thus, a limitation on Capsaicin content that would significantly reduce its skin irritation potential is expected to, in effect, lessen any concerns relating to tumor promotion potential. Because Capsaicin enhanced the penetration of an anti-inflammatory agent through human skin, the Panel recommends that care should be exercised in using ingredients that contain Capsaicin in cosmetic products. The Panel advised industry that the total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)/pesticide contamination should be limited to not more than 40 ppm, with not more than 10 ppm for any specific residue, and agreed on the following limitations for other impurities: arsenic (3 mg/kg max), heavy metals (0.002% max), and lead (5 mg/kg max). Industry was also advised that aflatoxin should not be present in these ingredients (the Panel adopted < or =15 ppb as corresponding to "negative" aflatoxin content), and that ingredients derived from Capsicum annuum and Capsicum Frutescens Plant species should not be used in products where N-nitroso compounds may be formed.

Final report on the safety assessment of phytantriol.	Phytantriol is an alcohol used in around 100 cosmetic products at concentrations ranging from 0.0002% to 1.0%, although uses at concentrations up to 3% are under development. Phytanriol is supplied at 95.2% and 96.0% purity. Impurities include water, sulphated ash, heavy metals, and a diastereomer of Phytantriol, 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxyhexadecane. Dermal penetration is low; skin permeability was calculated as log Kp = - 1.734. Oral LD50 values in mice and rats were reported to be > 5000 mg/kg. Ocular application of 100% Phytantriol did cause severe corneal damage in some animals, at 23% in diethyl phthalate only slight corneal opacity was seen, and at 10% transient opacity was seen, which resolved by 48 h. Phytantriol at 100% was a severe skin irritant in animal tests. Phytantriol at 3% and 10% in diethyl phthalate produced only slight erythema, which cleared by 48 h. Phytantriol, in the Longhorn egg chorioallantoic membrane assay, was found to have almost no irritation potential when tested at 3% concentration in corn oil. Phytantriol at 25% did produce sensitization in a maximization test, but concentrations of 1% and lower did not cause a sensitization response. Phytantriol is neither phototoxic nor photoallergenic. Phytantriol did not induce aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes, when tested within cytotoxicity limits, nor was it mutagenic in Ames tests, with or without metabolic activation. None of 101 human volunteers reacted initially or to challenge patches of 3% Phytantriol in corn oil. In another investigation of 227 volunteers induced and challenged with 3% Phytantriol in 70:30 ethyl alcohol/water, one person had a mild reaction to the first induction patch; this was the only positive reaction during the induction and challenge phases for all of the volunteers. Phytantriol had no adverse effects in any of 206 volunteer subjects in a repeat insult patch test at 5%. Although data were not available with which to assess reproductive and developmental toxicity and carcinogenic potential, there were no structural alerts suggesting that these end points should be of concern. Dermal penetration is low, and Phytantriol is not genotoxic. Although products containing this ingredient may be aerosolized, typical particle sizes for cosmetic aerosol products are larger than are respirable. Although this ingredient can be irritating and produce sensitization reactions at high concentrations, such effects are absent at lower concentrations. The Panel concluded that cosmetic products could be formulated at concentrations as high as 3% without significant irritation or sensitization.
Final report on the safety assessment of polyethylene.	Polyethylene is an ethylene polymer used for a variety of purposes in cosmetics as an abrasive, adhesive, binder or bulking agent, an emulsion stabilizer, a film former, an oral care agent, and as a nonaqueous viscosity-increasing agent. Polyethylene is also used in food packaging materials and medical products, including prosthetics. The molecular weight of Polyethylene as used in cosmetics varies over a wide range. The lowest reported molecular weight is 198 Daltons and the highest is 150,000. In any given polymer preparation, there can be a broad range of molecular weights. Cellular and tissue responses to Polyethylene, determined as part of implant biocompatibility testing, include fibrous connective tissue build-up around the implant material that varies as a function of the physical form of the implant material. Specific assays for osteoblast proliferation and collagen synthesis demonstrated a reduction as a function of exposure to Polyethylene particles that is inversely related to particle size. The effect of Polyurethane particles on monocyte-derived macrophages, however, had a stimulatory effect, prolonging the survival of these cells in culture. The LD50 for Polyethylene, with an average molecular weight of 450, in rats was > 2000 mg/kg. For Polyethylene with an average molecular weight of 655, the LD50 was > 5.0 g/kg. Toxicity testing in rats shows no adverse effects at Polyethylene (molecular weight not given) doses of 7.95 g/kg or at 1.25%, 2.50%, or 5.00% in feed for 90 days. Dermal irritation studies on rabbits in which 0.5 g of Polyethylene (average molecular weight of 450) was administered in 0.5 ml of water caused no irritation or corrosive effects; Polyethylene with an average molecular weight of 655 was a mild irritant. Polyethylene (average molecular weight of 450) did not cause dermal sensitization in guinea pigs tested with 50% Polyethylene (w/w) in arachis oil BP. Polyethylene, with a molecular weight of 450 and a molecular weight of 655, was a mild irritant when tested as a solid material in the eyes of rabbits. Rabbit eyes treated with a solution containing 13% Polyethylene beads produced minimal irritation and no corneal abrasions. No genotoxicity was found in bacterial assays. No chemical carcinogenicity has been seen in implantation studies, although particles from Polyethylene implants can induce so-called solid-state carcinogenicity, which is a physical reaction to an implanted material. Occupational case reports of ocular irritation and systemic sclerosis in workers exposed to Polyethylene have been difficult to interpret because such workers are also exposed to other irritants. Clinical testing of intrauterine devices made of Polyethylene failed to conclusively identify statistically significant adverse effects, although squamous metaplasia was observed. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel did not expect significant dermal absorption and systemic exposure to large Polyethylene polymers used in cosmetics. The Panel was concerned that information on impurities, including residual catalyst and reactants from the polymerization process, was not available. The Panel considered that the monomer unit in Polyethylene polymerization is ethylene. In the United States, ethylene is 99.9% pure. The other 0.1% includes ethane, propylene, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur, hydrogen, acetylene, water, and oxygen. The Panel believed that the concentration of these impurities in any final polymer would be so low as to not raise toxicity issues. Safety tests of cosmetic-grade Polyethylene have consistently failed to identify any toxicity associated with residual catalyst. Although it was reported that one process used to cross-link Polyethylene with an organic peroxide, this process is not currently used. In addition, cosmetic-grade Polyethylene is not expected to contain toxic hexanes. The Panel was concerned that the only genotoxicity data available was nonmammalian, but taking this information in concert with the absence of any chemical carcinogenicity in implant studies suggests no genotoxic mechanism for carcinogenicity. The solid-state carcinogenicity effect was not seen as relevant for Polyethylene as used in cosmetics. The available data support the conclusion that Polyethylene is safe for use in cosmetic formulations in the practices of use and concentrations described.
Adequacy and consistency of animal studies to evaluate the neurotoxicity of chronic low-level manganese exposure in humans.	The adequacy of existing animal studies to understand the effects of chronic low-level manganese exposures in humans is unclear. Here, a collection of subchronic to chronic rodent and nonhuman primate studies was evaluated to determine whether there is a consistent dose-response relationship among studies, whether there is a progression of effects with increasing dose, and whether these studies are adequate for evaluating the neurotoxicity of chronic low-level manganese exposures in humans. Neurochemical and behavioral effects were compared along the axis of estimated internal cumulative manganese dose, independent of the route of exposure. In rodents, motor effects emerged at cumulative doses below those where occupationally exposed humans start to show motor deficits. The main neurochemical effects in rodents were an increase in striatal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration throughout the internal cumulative dose range of 18 to 5300 mg Mn/kg but a variable effect on striatal dopamine concentration emerging at internal cumulative doses above approximately 200 mg Mn/kg. Monkey studies showed motor deficits and effects on the globus pallidus at relatively low doses and consistent harmful effects on both the globus pallidus and the caudate and putamen at higher doses (> 260 mg Mn/kg). Internal cumulative manganese doses of animal studies extend more than two orders of magnitude (< 1 to 5300 mg Mn/kg) above the doses at which occupationally exposed humans show neurological dysfunction (10-15 mg Mn/kg). Since the animal data indicate that manganese neurotoxicity may be different at low compared to elevated exposures, most existing animal model studies might be of limited relevance for the risk assessment of chronic low-level manganese exposure to humans.
Effects of short-term exposure to the DDT metabolite p,p'-DDE on bone tissue in male common frog (Rana temporaria).	Experimental studies as well as studies in free-ranging animals have shown that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) impair bone tissue composition and strength. The aim of the present study was to expand our studies on bone tissue in a new group of animals by investigating whether bone tissue in frogs is an additional potential target of EDCs. Adult male European common frogs (Rana temporaria) were divided into 5 groups (n = 20) and injected (sc, single injection) with p,p'-DDE, a total dose of 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 mg of p,p'-DDE/kg body weight, respectively. A control group was treated with the vehicle (corn oil). Two weeks after injection the frogs were euthanized and samples taken. The diaphysis of the excised left femur was scanned using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and cortical variables, such as cortical bone mineral density (BMD), cortical cross-sectional area (CSA), and periosteal circumference, were determined. In addition, biomechanical three-point bending of the bones was conducted, with the load being applied to the same point as where the pQCT measurement was performed. The results from the pQCT measurements show that bone tissue in male frogs exposed to p,p'-DDE is negatively affected. A significant decrease in cortical BMD at the diaphysis was observed in frogs exposed to 1 mg p,p'-DDE. However, the biomechanical testing of the bones showed no significant differences between exposed and control group. Although this is the only study performed to date examining the possible relationships between EDCs and negative effects on frog bones, it supports both previous experimental findings in rodents and findings in free-ranging animals.
Oxidative stress induced in PCB 126-exposed northern leopard frogs, Rana pipiens.	Northern leopard frogs Rana pipiens exposed to PCB 126 (3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl) were examined for hepatic oxidative stress. In a dose-response study, northern leopard frogs were injected intraperitoneally with either PCB 126 in corn oil (0.2, 0.7, 2.3, or 7.8 mg/kg body weight) or corn oil alone. In a time-course study, frogs received 7.8 mg/kg or corn oil alone, and were examined at 1, 2, 3, and 4 wk after dosing. Hepatic concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), and total sulfhydryls (total SH), as well as activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-P), GSSG reductase (GSSG-R), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH), and glutathione S-transferase (GSH-S-T) were measured. In the dose-response experiment, few effects were apparent 1 wk after dosing. In the time-course experiment, significant changes were observed in the 7.8-mg/kg group at 2 wk or more posttreatment. Hepatic concentrations of GSH and TBARS were higher than in corresponding controls at wk 3 and 4; the activities of GSSG-R and GSH-S-T were higher than in controls at wk 2 and 4; and the activity of G-6-PDH was increased at wk 2 and 4. These data collectively indicate that altered glutathione metabolism and oxidative stress occurred and were indicative of both toxicity and induction of protective mechanisms in frogs exposed to PCB. A similar delay in response was reported in fish and may relate to lower metabolic rate and physiological reactions in ectothermic vertebrates.
Structure-activity relationships for abiotic thiol reactivity and aquatic toxicity of halo-substituted carbonyl compounds.	Using abiotic thiol reactivity (EC50) and Tetrahymena pyriformis toxicity (IGC50) data for a group of halo-substituted ketones, esters and amides (i.e. SN2 electrophiles) and related compounds a series of structure-activity relationships are illustrated. Only the alpha-halo-carbonyl-containing compounds are observed to be thiol reactive with the order I > Br > Cl > F. Further comparisons disclose alpha-halo-carbonyl compounds to be more reactive than non-alpha-halo-carbonyl compounds; in addition, the reactivity is reduced when the number of C atoms between the carbonyl and halogen is greater than one. Comparing reactivity among alpha-halo-carbonyl-containing compounds with different beta-alkyl groups shows the greater the size of the beta-alkyl group the lesser the reactivity. A comparison of reactivity data for 2-bromoacetyl-containing compounds of differing dimensions reveals little difference in reactivity. Regression analysis demonstrates a linear relationship between toxicity and thiol reactivity: log (IGC(50)(-1)) = 0.848 log (EC(50)(-1)) + 1.40; n=19, s=0.250, r2=0.926, r2(pred)=0.905, F=199, Pr > F=0.0001.
Hepatic transcript levels for genes coding for enzymes associated with xenobiotic metabolism are altered with age.	Metabolism studies are crucial for data interpretation from rodent toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. Metabolism studies are usually conducted in 6 to 8 week old rodents. Long-term studies often continue beyond 100 weeks of age. The potential for age-related changes in transcript levels of genes encoding for enzymes associated with metabolism was evaluated in the liver of male F344/N rats at 32, 58, and 84 weeks of age. Differential expression was found between the young and old rats for genes whose products are involved in both phase I and phase II metabolic pathways. Thirteen cytochrome P450 genes from CYP families 1-3 showed alterations in expression in the older rats. A marked age-related decrease in expression was found for 4 members of the Cyp3a family that are critical for drug metabolism in the rat. Immunohistochemical results confirmed a significant decrease in Cyp3a2 and Cyp2c11 protein levels with age. This indicates that the metabolic capacity of male rats changes throughout a long-term study. Conducting multiple hepatic microarray analyses during the conduct of a long-term study can provide a global view of potential metabolic changes that might occur. Alterations that are considered crucial to the interpretation of long-term study results could then be confirmed by subsequent metabolic studies.
Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis in a cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis).	Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis characterized by multifocal follicular lymphoid cell infiltrates with germinal centers, thyroid acinar atrophy and pituitary cell hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the adenohypophysis was detected in a vehicle control, 4-year-old female Cynomolgus macaque in a routine toxicology study. Lymphoid cells of germinal centers were positive for the B-cell marker CD20 by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while remaining lymphocytes were positive for the T-cell marker CD3. Hypertrophied/hyperplastic pituitary cells were positive for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) by IHC, consistent with an adaptive response due to removal of hormonal negative feedback from the diseased thyroid gland. Features of this case are similar to chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis in humans, an autoimmune disorder also known as Hashimoto's disease. Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis with compensatory pituitary changes may occur spontaneously in young, clinically normal cynomolgus macaques and its presence in drug treated animals should be interpreted with caution.
Linkage of biochemical responses to population-level effects: a case study with vitellogenin in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas).	A challenge in the field of ecotoxicology is the linkage of alterations at molecular and biochemical levels of organization to adverse outcomes in individuals and populations. In the present study, a predictive relationship between plasma vitellogenin (VTG) concentration and fecundity in female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) was derived from 21-d laboratory toxicity tests with five chemicals (17beta-trenbolone, 17alpha-trenbolone, prochloraz, fenarimol, and fadrozole) that inhibit VTG production through different mechanisms. Because VTG is key to egg production in female oviparous animals, changes in the lipoprotein could, theoretically, serve as an indicator of reproductive success. Regression of fecundity versus VTG concentration from the various studies yielded a highly significant linear model (fecundity = -0.042 + 0.95 x VTG, p < 0.01, r2 = 0.88). This relationship was integrated into a population model to translate changes in VTG concentrations of female fathead minnows to alterations in population growth. The model predicted relatively profound effects on population size of fish experiencing moderate decreases in vitellogenesis. For example, a fathead minnow population at a carrying capacity exposed to a chemical stressor that causes a 25% decrease in VTG concentration in females from baseline values would exhibit a 34.6% projected decrease in size after two years of exposure and reach an equilibrium population size that was only 30.2% of the preexposed population. Overall, the current study provides an example of how changes in a biomarker (VTG concentration) can be quantitatively translated into adverse effects at the individual and population levels.
Toxicity of cadmium to six species in two genera of crayfish and the effect of cadmium on molting success.	Nine acute (96-h) toxicity tests were conducted on six species of crayfish (Cambaridae). Six tests focused on adults, and three tests examined juveniles. Lethal concentration to 50% of a population (LC50) and lethal concentration to 10% of a population (LC10) values, respectively, for the adults of individual test species were as follows: Orconectes juvenilis, 2.44 and 0.623 mg Cd/L; Orconectes placidus, 0.487 and 0.092 mg Cd/L; Orconectes virilis, 3.30 and 0.947 mg Cd/L; Procambarus acutus, 0.368 and 0.048 mg Cd/L; Procambarus alleni, 3.07 and 0.386 mg Cd/L; and Procambarus clarkii, 2.66 and 0.486 mg Cd/L. The Orconectes LC50 genus mean acute value (GMAV) was 1.57 mg Cd/L, whereas the LC50 GMAV for Procambarus was 1.44 mg Cd/L. The LC10 GMAVs were 0.379 and 0.208 mg Cd/L, respectively. Family mean acute values (FMAVs) also were calculated for the Cambaridae using all species data (LC50, 1.51 mg Cd/L; LC10, 0.281 mg Cd/L). For tests with juvenile crayfish, the LC50 and LC10 values, respectively, were as follows: O. juvenilis, 0.060 and 0.014 mg Cd/L; O. placidus, 0.037 and 0.002 mg Cd/L; and P. clarkii, 0.624 and 0.283 mg Cd/L. The GMAVs were calculated for juvenile Orconectes (LC50, 0.047 mg Cd/L; LC10, 0.005 mg Cd/L). Additionally, FMAVs were calculated for juvenile crayfish (LC50, 0.111 mg Cd/L; LC10, 0.020 mg Cd/L). Crayfish sensitivity to Cd varied by a factor of nine among species tested as adults and by a factor of 17 among species tested as juveniles. Molting was a sensitive life stage for crayfish. Most individuals that molted shortly before or during exposure to Cd died, whereas all controls that molted in the adult assays survived. Because molting is a sensitive, recurring life-cycle event, molting individuals should be included in toxicological analysis despite some contrary recommendations.
Impact of 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene (3,4-DGE) on cytotoxicity of acidic heat-sterilized peritoneal dialysis fluid.	Of the glucose degradation products (GDPs) in glucose-rich peritoneal dialysate, we investigated the influence of 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene (3,4-DGE) on the cytotoxicity of acidic heat-sterilized peritoneal dialysis fluid (L-H PDF) using human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC). We prepared acidified filtration-sterilized PDF (glucose concentration 3.86%) containing eight types of added GDP [3,4-DGE, glyoxal (GO), methylglyoxal (MGO), 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG), formaldehyde (FA), acetaldehyde (AA), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (5-HMF), and furfural (FF)] or seven types of GDP (GO, MGO, 3-DG, FA, AA, 5-HMF, and FF). HPMC were exposed to these two types of solution and acidic heat-sterilized PDF (glucose concentration 3.86%, L-H 3.86) for 4 h. Cell viability was determined by 3,(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl-terazolium bromide (MTT) assay. MTT viability was decreased significantly compared with the control when treated with L-H 3.86 or acidified neutral filtration-sterilized PDF (glucose concentration 3.86%) containing eight GDPs. However, no significant decrease in MTT viability was observed when HPMC were treated with acidified neutral filtration-sterilized PDF (glucose concentration 3.86%) containing seven GDPs. Thus, 3,4-DGE strongly affects the cytotoxicity of L-H PDF. It is suggested that the cytotoxicity of L-H PDF is based on the presence of 3,4-DGE.
Succimer chelation improves learning, attention, and arousal regulation in lead-exposed rats but produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure.	There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels. However, very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children, or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure.
Cascade synthesis of polyoxygenated 6H,11H-[2]benzopyrano-[4,3-c][1]benzopyran-11-ones.	2-(methoxymethoxymethyl)aryllead triacetates, obtained in situ from the corresponding arylboronic acids, reacted with 4-hydroxycoumarins, leading to 3-(2-methoxymethoxymethyl)aryl-4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives in good to high yields. These compounds underwent a cascade sequence of reactions, deprotection-halogenation-annulation, to afford polyoxygenated tetracyclic 6H,11H-[2]benzopyrano-[4,3-c] [1]benzopyran-11-ones in good yields. Some compounds showed a moderate cytotoxicity against human epithelial mammary HBL100 cells.
Possibilities of chemical weed control in Lupinus albus and Lupinus luteus-screening of herbicides.	Weed control in sweet lupins is still a problem. Especially the phytotoxicity of herbicides in sweet lupins is not enough studied. Therefore a screening with 16 selected herbicides and 4 lupin varieties has been set up. During the growing season 2005, 10 of the tested herbicides were applied in pre-emergence, 6 in post-emergence. Pre-emergence: Most of the active matters tested in pre-emergence were not phytotoxic for lupins. Pendimethalin (1000 g/ha), linuron (500 g/ha), chlorotoluron (1500 g/ha), prosulfocarb (2400 g/ha), clomazone (72 g/ha), isoxaben (100 g/ha), metamitron (1050 g/ha) and dimethenamid-P (720 g/ha) were applied without causing any significant phytotoxic symptoms. Only the lupins treated with aclonifen (1200 g/ha) showed a significant growth inhibition, 3 weeks after treatment. Significantly more chlorosis was noticed when the lupins were treated with aclonifen or with diflufenican, in preemergence. Post-emergence: In post-emergence, diflufenican (50 g/ha) did not cause any crop damage. Florasulam (5 g/ha) caused almost 100% necrosis in L. albus as well as in L. luteus. Bentazon (652 g/ha), thifensulfuron-methyl (15 g/ha) and metribuzin (175 g/ha) caused obvious necrosis and growth inhibition of the crop. The growth inhibition was significantly more severe for lupins treated with bentazon than if they were treated with thifensulfuron-methyl or metribuzin. Three weeks after treatment, clomazone (90 g/ha) and diflufenican (50 g/ha), did not cause any crop injury at all. The results indicated an interesting range of active matters which can be applied in pre-emergence, but weed control in post-emergence stays difficult.
A comparative study on the toxic effects of textile dye wastewaters (untreated and treated) on mortality and RBC of a freshwater fish Gambusia affinis (Baird and Gerard).	Comparative toxicological studies of textile dye wastewater (untreated and treated) on a freshwater fish, Gambusia affinis, revealed a marked reduction in mortality and cytotoxic effects on RBCs, measured as reduction in their counts and percent changes in their shape (poikilocytosis) and variation in their size (anisocytosis)}, after subjecting them to both physicochemical and biological treatments. On comparing the data of mortality and the cytotoxic effects on RBCs, we found poikilocytosis is a better indicator for toxicity measurement of both untreated as well as treated wastewater, especially at their lowest concentrations where percent mortality was found to be either nil or lowerer than the percentage of poikilocytic RBCs. Although percent reduction in RBC counts and changes in their size (anisocytosis) indicated toxic effects of wastewaters, but EC5o values for RBC counts were usually higher than those for poikilocytosis and mortality, and non-calculable for anisocytosis suggesting their lesser sensitivity to pollutants. In view of these findings, we recommend monitoring of toxic effects of wastewaters during fish bioassay on both mortality and variation in RBC shape.
Insecticide toxicity and synergism by enzyme inhibitors in 18 species of pest insect and natural enemies in crucifer vegetable crops.	The toxicities of three enzyme inhibitors and their synergistic effects on four insecticides were studied by using the dry film method on field populations of 18 species of insects collected in Jianxin and Shanjie, China, from 2003 to 2005. Meanwhile, the inhibitory effects of these enzyme inhibitors on the activities of acetylcholinesterases (AChE), carboxyesterases (CarE) and glutathione-S-transferases (GST), in vivo, were also studied. In general, triphenyl phosphate (TPP) and diethyl maleate (DEM) showed low toxicities to six herbivorous pest insects, four ladybirds and eight parasitoids. Piperonyl butoxide (PB) exhibited low toxicities to the herbivorous pest insects and ladybirds, but high toxicities to the eight parasitoids. The tolerance to the insecticides in 11 pest insects and natural enemies was mainly associated with the tolerance to PB. PB showed the highest synergism on methamidophos, fenvalerate, fipronil and avermectin in nine species of pest insects and natural enemies. In general, TPP and DEM showed significant synergisms to these four insecticides in four parasitoid species. However, in contrast to their effects on the parasitoids, the synergistic effects of TPP and DEM on the four insecticides by TPP and DEM against four pest insects and one ladybird varied depending on the insect species and enzyme inhibitor. Activity of AChE, CarE or GST could be strongly inhibited, in vivo, by PB, TPP or DEM, depending on the insect species and enzyme inhibitors. From the results obtained in this study, mixed-function oxidase (MFO) was thought to play the most critical role in insect tolerances to the tested insecticides in the field. Low competition existed in the evolution of insecticide resistance in the field populations of parasitoids, as compared with herbivorous pest insects and ladybirds. Possible causes of the high synergistic effects of PB on the four classes of insecticides, based on multiattack on the activity of CarE, GST or AChE in the insect species, are also discussed.
Free radical generation during the activation of hemolymph prepared from the homopteran Dactylopius coccus.	Superoxide anion (O(-) (2)) and nitric oxide (NO) generation in Dactylopius coccus hemolymph obtained by perfusion and activated with zymosan was studied. Activated hemolymph reduced 3-[4,5 dimethylthiazolil-2]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide. This reduction was prevented by superoxide dismutase (SOD) indicating O(-) (2) generation. This activity was dependent on temperature, and hemolymph incubated at 75 degrees C lost its activity. Chromatocytes incubated with zymosan released their content and produced O(-) (2). Activated hemolymph also produced NO and this activity was prevented in the presence of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, suggesting that nitric oxide synthase (NOS) might be present in D. coccus hemolymph. The probable source of O(-) (2) in the D. coccus hemolymph is the anthraquinone oxidation, since commercial carminic dye produced O(-) (2) during its oxidation by Agaricus bisporus tyrosinase. Gram+ Micrococcus luteus exposed to activated hemolymph were killed in vitro, and addition of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and D-Mannitol (a hydroxyl radical scavenger) prevented their killing. The cytotoxic effect produced by the activated hemolymph was not observed with the Gram- bacteria Serratia marcescens. These results suggest that D. coccus activated hemolymph generates reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) that may limit M. luteus growth.
Induction of cell death, DNA strand breaks, and cell cycle arrest in DU145 human prostate carcinoma cell line by benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide.	Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, is a major environmental pollutant. In this study, the effects of this carcinogen/mutagen and one of its metabolites, benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), on human prostate carcinoma cell line DU145, were examined. Cell viability, DNA damage, and cell cycle progression were evaluated as toxic end-points. We have shown that B[a]P and BPDE inhibited cell viability following 48 hr of exposure. Furthermore, comet assay analyses revealed that both B[a]P and BPDE induced DNA strand breaks in a concentration-dependent fashion. Flow cytometric analyses showed that about 70% of DU145 cells were arrested by B[a]P at the G1 phase, while about 76% were arrested at G1 phase by BPDE. These data reveal that B[a]P and BPDE are cytotoxic and genotoxic to DU145 prostate cancer cells.
Alterations in the concentrations of liver mitochondrial DNA, cytoplasmic total hydrocarbon and calcium in Guinea pigs after treatment with Nigerian light crude oil.	The alteration of cellular calcium sequestration has been postulated to be a primary mechanism in the initiation of irreversible cell damage. Crude oil has been shown to cause concentration- dependent inhibition of calcium influx and mitochondrial swelling which may relate to its toxicity. Nigerian 'Bonny' Light Crude Oil (BLCO) is produced in the Niger-Delta region of Nigeria where oil spills are frequent and can endanger human-health, yet BLCO has not been studied in this regard. We have studied the effects of two doses of BLCO on mitochondrial DNA (mt.DNA), cytoplasmic total hydrocarbon concentrations (cyt.THC) and cytoplasmic Ca2+ (cyt.Ca2+) concentrations in livers of adult male guinea pigs exposed by intraperitoneal injection. The results showed that at 2.5 and 5.0 (ml/kg bw), BLCO caused dose-related increases in mt.DNA concentrations (128% and 485%) respectively over the controls, and cyt.THC (47.5% and 100%) respectively; while it caused near-100% decrease in cyt.Ca2+ concentrations (94% and 96.8%) respectively lower than the controls. These results suggest that BLCO caused the increased availability of crude oil hydrocarbons in the liver cells, and subsequent induction of unscheduled mt.DNA synthesis, and alteration of mitochondrial/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sequestration or ca2+ - concentration gradient, leading to the inhibition of Ca2+ influx into the cytosol. These events may explain the probable hepatotoxicity of BLCO.
Screening of natural product biocides for control of non-indigenous species.	Several benzo-, naphtho- and anthraquinones were tested for their efficacy as biocides in controlling aquatic nuisance species in ships' ballast water. A requirement of this application was broad spectrum aquatic toxicity, coupled with a relatively rapid rate of degradation, in order to comply with coastal discharge requirements. Compounds were screened using a suite of toxicity bioassays designed to establish their relative toxicity to an array of planktonic organisms including larval bivalves Dreissena and Crassostrea, various developmental stages of the estuarine copepod Eurytemora affinis, brine shrimp larvae (Artemia salina), the freshwater invasive water flea Bythotrephes, larval sheepshead minnows CCyprinodon variegates) and two unicellular algal genera Isochrysis and Neochloris.. The majority of the data were recorded as the lowest concentration of the test compound resulting in complete mortality or inactivation of test organisms (LC ,m). The naphthoquinones juglone, plumbagin, menadione and naphthazarin showed the highest toxicity to the broadest range of organisms, often at levels much less than 1 mg l(-1), and most of the attention was focused on this group. While plumbagin and juglone appeared overall to be the most toxic compounds, it was concluded that menadione was probably the most cost-effective candidate compound for shipboard use for controlling invasive species in ballast water, particularly in view of the large volumes of water that would require treatment.
Development of a site-specific ecological risk assessment for contaminated sites: part I. A multi-criteria based system for the selection of ecotoxicological tests and ecological observations.	A two modules Decision Support System (DSS-ERAMANIA) was developed in order to support the site-specific Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) for contaminated sites. Within the first module, the TRIAD and the Weight of Evidence approaches were used to develop a site-specific Ecological Risk Assessment framework including three tires of investigation. Selected ecological observations and ecotoxicological tests were compared according to Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods and expert judgment, and the obtained ranking was used to identify a suitable set of tests, at each investigation tier, to be applied to the examined case study. A simplified application of the proposed methodology, implemented in the Module 1 of the DSS-ERA-MANIA, is described and discussed.
C terminal half fragment (50 kDa) of heavy chain components of Clostridium botulinum type C and D neurotoxins can be used as an effective vaccine.	Recombinant whole heavy chains (H, 100 kDa) and their N-terminal (Hn, 50 kDa) and C-terminal (Hc, 50 kDa) half fragments of Clostridium botulinum type C and D neurotoxins were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. GST eliminated-preparations of H (10 microg), Hn (5 microg), Hc (5 microg), or a mixture of Hn (5 microg) and Hc (5 microg) of types C and D were mixed with an equal volume of adjuvant, and then were twice injected into mice subcutaneously. After immunization, the mice were challenged with up to 10(6) the minimum lethal doses (MLD)/0.5 ml of C or D toxin, the type of which was same as that of the immunogens. All of the mice immunized with antigens except for Hn survived against 10(5) to 10(6) MLD/0.5 ml of the toxins, but the mice immunized with Hn were killed by 100 MLD/0.5 ml. The mice immunized with a mixture of C-Hc and D-Hc, each 5 microg, also showed a high level of resistance against both C and D toxins. Antibody levels immunized with GST fused-or GST eliminatedpreparation were quite similar. These results indicate that recombinant GST-fused Hc can be used as a safe and effective vaccine for type C and D botulism in animals. It also became clear that one time inoculation with a large amount of C-Hc or D-Hc, 100 microg, is useful for vaccine trials in mice.
Hazard characterization and identification of a former ammunition site using microarrays, bioassays, and chemical analysis.	More than 100,000 tons of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene were produced at the former ammunition site Werk Tanne in Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany. The production of explosives and consequent detonation in approximately 1944 by the Allies caused great pollution in this area. Four soil samples and three water samples were taken from this site and characterized by applying chemical-analytical methods and several bioassays. Ecotoxicological test systems, such as the algal growth inhibition assay with Desmodesmus subspicatus, and genotoxicity tests, such as the umu and NM2009 tests, were performed. Also applied were the Ames test, according to International Organization for Standardization 16240, and an Ames fluctuation test. The toxic mode of action was examined using bacterial gene profiling assays with a battery of Escherichia coli strains and with the human liver cell line hepG2 using the PIQOR Toxicology cDNA microarray. Additionally, the molecular mechanism of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene in hepG2 cells was analyzed. The present assessment indicates a danger of pollutant leaching for the soil-groundwater path. A possible impact for human health is discussed, because the groundwater in this area serves as drinking water.
Removal of cadmium ions during stationary growth phase by an extremely cadmium-resistant strain of Stenotrophomonas sp.	Stenotrophomonas sp. CD02 was isolated from a site that previously had been contaminated with high concentrations of the heavy metals cadmium (3 mg kg(-1)) and chromium (115 mg kg(-1)). This strain was able to grow on complex (Luria Bertani) medium containing high concentrations of cadmium ion (up to 4 mM). Additionally, it could remove up to 80% of the dissolved ions but only after reaching stationary growth phase. Strain CD02 also tolerated high concentrations of other heavy metals such as chromium, zinc, copper, nickel, and lead at levels more than 2 mM. Although strain CD02 can tolerate much higher cadmium concentrations than the three Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains tested, they all possess resistance to the same range of antibiotics. This suggests that strain CD02 possesses a mechanism that allows it to tolerate and remove cadmium differently from those conferring resistance to antibiotics. Strain CD02 can be a suitable candidate for heavy metal bioremediation in contaminated environment because it is able to tolerate high concentration of heavy metals and remove cadmium aerobically.
Effect of carbon nanotubes on developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.	The impact of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the aquatic environment was investigated by examining the properties of raw CNTs under several environmental conditions and using developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. The agglomerate size for single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) was significantly larger at pH 11 or greater and was stable at temperatures from 4 to 40 degrees C and salinities from 0 to 30 ppt. Exposure to SWCNTs induced a significant hatching delay in zebrafish embryos between 52 to 72 h postfertilization (hpf) at concentrations of greater than 120 mg/L, but 99% of the exposed embryos hatched by 75 hpf. Double-walled CNTs also induced a hatching delay at concentrations of greater than 240 mg/L, but carbon black did not affect hatching at the concentrations tested. Molecular and cellular analysis showed that the embryonic development of the exposed embryos up to 96 hpf was not affected at SWCNT concentrations of up to 360 mg/L. Scanning-electron microscopic inspection showed that the size of the pores on the embryo chorion was nanoscaled and that the size of SWCNT agglomerates was microscaled or larger, indicating that the chorion of zebrafish embryos was an effective protective barrier to SWCNT agglomerates. The hatching delay observed in this study likely was induced by the Co and Ni catalysts used in the production of SWCNTs that remained at trace concentrations after purification. This study suggests that materials associated with raw SWCNTs (perhaps metal contaminants) have the potential to affect aquatic life when released into the aquatic environment.
Deterministic and probabilistic acute-based environmental risk assessment for naproxen for western Europe.	An environmental risk assessment (ERA) was made for the common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen. The ERA was performed according to deterministic and probabilistic methods, based on different predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) and measured environmental concentrations (MECs) on the exposure side as well as on published and newly elaborated acute ecotoxicity data on the effects side. Compilation of a large set of MECs allowed a qualification of the various PEC derivations. The European Medicines Evaluation Authority (EMEA) phase I PEC was shown to be far above realistic values, while the refined EMEA phase II (A and B) PECs were not too far from the 95th percentile MEC, in agreement with their nature as local PECs. The western European continental and regional PECs extrapolated based on actual use data, using the European Union system for the evaluation of substances, with the region reconfigured for Germany where most of the available European MECs are from, were in good to very close agreement with the median MECs. No risk to surface waters is apparent by any of the methodologies applied from the current use of naproxen; however, because only insufficient chronic ecotoxicity data are available, this is a preliminary conclusion.
The effect of copper concentration on the virulence of pathogenic Vibrio harveyi.	To demonstrate the influence of copper on luminescence and toxin production in Vibrio harveyi.
Ethyl tertiary-butyl ether: a toxicological review.	A number of oxygenated compounds (oxygenates) are available for use in gasoline to reduce vehicle exhaust emissions, reduce the aromatic compound content, and avoid the use of organo-lead compounds, while maintaining high octane numbers. Ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE) is one such compound. The current use of ETBE in gasoline or petrol is modest but increasing, with consequently similar trends in the potential for human exposure. Inhalation is the most likely mode of exposure, with about 30% of inhaled ETBE being retained by the lungs and distributed around the body. Following cessation of exposure, the blood concentration of ETBE falls rapidly, largely as a result of its metabolism to tertiary-butyl alcohol (TBA) and acetaldehyde. TBA may be further metabolized, first to 2-methyl-1,2-propanediol and then to 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, the two dominant metabolites found in urine of volunteers and rats. The rapid oxidation of acetaldehyde suggests that its blood concentration is unlikely to rise above normal as a result of human exposure to sources of ETBE. Single-dose toxicity tests show that ETBE has low toxicity and is essentially nonirritant to eyes and skin; it did not cause sensitization in a maximization test in guinea pigs. Neurological effects have been observed only at very high exposure concentrations. There is evidence for an effect of ETBE on the kidney of rats. Increases in kidney weight were seen in both sexes, but protein droplet accumulation (with alpha(2u)-globulin involvement) and sustained increases in cell proliferation occurred only in males. In liver, centrilobular necrosis was induced in mice, but not rats, after exposure by inhalation, although this lesion was reported in some rats exposed to very high oral doses of ETBE. The proportion of liver cells engaged in S-phase DNA synthesis was increased in mice of both sexes exposed by inhalation. ETBE has no specific effects on reproduction, development, or genetic material. Carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with ETBE, TBA, and ethanol (included in this review as an endogenous precursor of acetaldehyde in the absence of TBA). A single experiment with ETBE in rats and several experiments with ethanol in rats and mice were not considered adequate for an evaluation of ETBE carcinogenicity. In male rats only, TBA induced alpha(2u)-globulin nephropathy-related renal tubule adenomas. These are generally considered to have no human relevance. In addition, increases in thyroid follicular cell adenoma incidence were associated with TBA treatment in female mice. This result lacks independent confirmation and is not supported by experiments in which similar or higher internal doses of TBA were delivered.
Temperature-dependent variation in toxicity of insecticides against Earias vitella (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).	The toxicity of synthetic pyrethroids was found to be negatively correlated with temperature, whereas contrasting correlation was observed with the toxicity of organophosphorous compounds chlorpyriphos and quinalphos, which was most toxic at higher temperature. A similar phenomenon was observed in endosulfan at higher temperature and humidity combination. The insecticide molecules indoxacarb and spinosad were effective among the insecticides tested. Indoxacarb was effective at lower temperature, and spinosad was effective at all the temperature and relative humidity combinations with minor difference in LD50 values. During both the years, however, the levels of resistance were higher in second year compared with previous year.
Effects of azadirachtin, abamectin, and spinosad on sweetpotato whitefly (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae) on tomato plants under laboratory and greenhouse conditions in the humid tropics.	Direct and residual toxicity of NeemAzal-T/S (azadirachtin), Success (spinosad), and abamectin was tested against different life stages of sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae), under air-conditioned laboratory conditions and in a tropical net greenhouse. NeemAzal-T/S and abamectin deterred the settling of adults on tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill (Solanaceae), plants and consequently reduced egg deposition. No such effect was detected for Success. All three pesticides influenced egg hatch. Effects of NeemAzal-T/ S were significantly altered if applied to different-aged eggs (1, 3, and 5 d old). In contrast, abamectin-treated eggs failed to hatch at any given age class. All three products caused heavy mortality of the three nymphal stages of B. tabaci, with the first instars being most susceptible, abamectin-treated nymphs died within 24 h postapplication. In contrast, 100% nymphal mortality with NeemAzal-T/S and Success was reached 6-9 d postapplication. abamectin caused 100% immature mortality at all residue ages (1, 5, 10, and 15 d) in the laboratory and greenhouse as well. Persistence of Success was comparably high in the laboratory, but in the greenhouse a faster decline of activity was evident by increased egg deposition, egg hatch, and reduced rates of immature mortality. Toxicity of NeemAzal-T/S however gradually declined under greenhouse conditions with time (5 d) postapplication. The findings are discussed within the context of integrated management of whitefly under protected cultivation in the humid tropics.
Residual effects of imidacloprid on Japanese beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) oviposition, egg hatch, and larval viability in turfgrass.	Preventive control of turf-infesting scarabaeid grubs by neonicotinoid insecticides is presumed to mainly result from residues killing first instars in the soil. The extent to which sublethal behavioral effects or intoxication of other life stages contribute to such control is poorly known. We tested whether Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman, females lay fewer eggs in turf treated with imidacloprid (Merit 75 WP) or an imidacloprid-bifenthrin combination (Allectus GC SC), and whether exposure to those residues in thatch and soil reduces their survival and subsequent ability to feed or take flight. Effects of imidacloprid residues on egg hatch and viability of successive larval instars also were studied. In two sets of choice tests, 68 and 82% fewer eggs were laid in Kentucky bluegrass with Allectus residues than in controls. When females were confined in treated turf, however, neither insecticide consistently reduced their fecundity or affected depth at which eggs were laid, although exposure to fresh Allectus residues reduced the beetles' subsequent viability. Imidacloprid residues up to 2 ppm in soil did not affect egg viability or days to hatch, but they killed neonates soon after eclosion. Imidacloprid curatively applied at label rate (0.34 kg active ingredient/ha) reduced weight gain, burrowing capability, frass production, and survival of second and third instars in turfgrass cores, with high mortality within 30 d. Intoxication and behavioral impairment of third instars also occurred in autumn field trials. Our data suggest that imidacloprid has greater activity against late instars than is generally appreciated.
Activity of an essential oil derived from Chenopodium ambrosioides on greenhouse insect pests.	This study involved both greenhouse and laboratory experiments evaluating the effect of an essential oil product (QRD 400) derived from Chenopodium ambrosioides variety nr. Ambrosioides L. (Chenopodiaceae) on greenhouse insect pests that feed on different plant parts: citrus mealybug, Planococcus citri (Risso); longtailed mealybug, Pseudococcus longispinus (Targioni Tozzetti); western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), and fungus gnats (Bradysia spp.). Treatments were applied to coleus, Solenostemon scutellarioides plants; transvaal daisy, Gerbera jamesonii flowers; or growing medium, depending on the insect pest. The essential oil was most effective, based on adult emergence, on both the second and third instars of the fungus gnat Bradysia sp. nr. coprophila when applied as a drench to growing medium. In addition, there was a significant rate response for QRD 400 on fungus gnats. The QRD 400 treatment had the highest percentage of mortality on longtailed mealybug (55%) compared with the other treatments. However, the essential oil was less effective against citrus mealybug (3% mortality) and western flower thrips adults (18-34% mortality) compared with standard insecticides, such as acetamiprid (TriStar) and spinosad (Conserve), which are typically used by greenhouse producers. This lack of efficacy may be associated with volatility and short residual properties of the essential oil or with the essential oil taking longer to kill insect pests. Other insecticides and miticides evaluated, including sesame oil, garlic, paraffinic oil, and Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis, provided minimal control of the designated insect pests. In addition, adult rove beetle Atheta coriaria Kraatz adults were not effective in controlling the larval instars of fungus gnats when applied at a rate of five adults per container.
Historical review of termite activity at forest service termiticide test sites from 1971 to 2004.	The U.S. Forest Service has a long history of providing termiticide efficacy data used for product registration and labeling. Four primary test sites (Arizona and Florida, Mississippi, and South Carolina [hereafter southeast]) have been used for this purpose. Various parameters of termite attack at water-only control plots were examined in this study to assess the relative pressures of termites at each site. Termiticide studies installed between 1971 and 2001 by using ground board (GB) and concrete slab (CS) test methods were included. GB control plots were attacked 85% of the time in the southeast, about twice the rate observed in Arizona (43%). CS plots were attacked 59-70% of the time in the southeast, significantly higher than in Arizona (43%). Termites were slower to initiate attack at control plots in Arizona compared with the southeast, and they were up to twice as slow at GB controls. Once initial attack began, GB plots were reattacked at higher percentages in the southeast (89-90%) than in Arizona (67%). Reattack at CS plots ranged from 65% in Arizona and South Carolina to 76% in Mississippi. Termites caused less damage to wooden blocks in control plots in Arizona than the southeast. Attack rates at controls generally declined during the 1990s, but these rates have rebounded since 2000, except at CS plots in Arizona and South Carolina. Statistical analysis of attacks at plots treated with chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, fenvalerate, and permethrin also was undertaken. Time to initial termite attack (failure) of the organophosphate chlorpyrifos was generally shorter in Arizona than in the southeast, whereas time to initial attack in plots treated with one of three pyrethroids (cypermethrin, fenvalerate, and permethrin) was generally longer in Arizona.
Toxicity, uptake, and transfer efficiency of fipronil in western subterranean termite (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae).	The potential horizontal transfer ofnonrepellent termiticides has become an important paradigm to control termites in recent years. In this study, 14C-radiolabeled fipronil was used in a series of laboratory experiments to demonstrate the extent and ability of termites to transfer lethal amounts of fipronil to unexposed nestmates. Fipronil is an active and nonrepellent termiticide against western subterranean termites, Reticulitermes hesperus Banks, on sand at relevant doses. It exhibited delayed toxicity with the lowest LD50 approximately 0.2 ng/termite expressed between day 4 and 7. Both continuous and brief exposures to fipronil-treated sand seriously impaired the termite's ability to move and respond to a dodecatrienol trail, limiting potential horizontal transfer. In tunneling studies, fipronil prevented termite tunneling at concentrations as low as 0.5 ppm and was nonrepellent even at 500 ppm. Greater than 90% mortality was recorded by day 7 with concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 500 ppm. There was a linear relationship between the time of exposure and uptake of [14C]fipronil when termites were continuously exposed to 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 ppm for 24 h. However, uptake discontinued when the termites were immobilized. Maximum transfer of fipronil from donors to recipients occurred within the first 24 h. Fipronil was transferred by body contact and trophallaxis did not play a major role in horizontal transfer. In successive transfer studies, there was not enough fipronil on recipients for them to serve as secondary donors and kill other termites. In a linear arena study, there was an inverse relationship between the amount offipronil on dead termites and their distance from the treated zone. Maximum mortality was observed within 1.5 m from the treated zone. Results in our laboratory studies suggest that horizontal transfer was not a major factor contributing to the efficacy of fipronil in the field.
Indirect selection for increased susceptibility to permethrin in diamondback moth (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae).	We have been exploring the behavioral response ot insect pests to heterogeneous distribution of toxins (low dose with refugia), and its genetic correlation with physiological tolerance to these toxins. A field-collected population of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostellu (L.) (Lepidoptera Plutellidae), from Celeryville, OH, was selected with permethrin to determine whether low heterogeneous doses could lead to increased susceptibility to permethrin by selecting indirectly on behavior. Two replicates of each of three selection regimes: uniform high concentration hypothesized to result in increased physiological tolerance, heterogeneous low concentration hypothesized to result in increased susceptibility through indirect selection on behavior, and a control with no exposure to permethrin, were maintained in 1-in3 cages in a greenhouse, for 33 generations. All life stages of the diamondback moth were exposed to the selection regimes, and new generations were started with a random selection of pupae from the previous generation. Lines selected with uniform high concentrations developed 76-fold levels of resistance to permethrin by the 17th generation, with little changes thereafter. For generations 1-20, lines selected with heterogeneous low concentrations remained slightly lower in LC50 but not significantly different from the unselected control lines. Based on confidence intervals from probit analyses, the LC50 of the lines selected with heterogeneous low concentration, however, were significantly lower than those of the control lines in generations 21-33. Our results demonstrate that selection on behavioral responses can result in greater susceptibility than no selection at all, despite exposure to the toxin and ample genetic variation and potential for increased physiological tolerance. The implications of our findings, which are based on selection scenarios that could take place in field situations, are that behavioral responses can prevent and even decrease the levels of resistance in insect populations, an important result with respect to resistance and resistance management.
Toxicity, synergism, and neurological effects of novel volatile insecticides in insecticide-susceptible and -resistant Drosophila strains.	Naturally derived volatile insecticides from the heterobicyclic and formate ester classes were investigated using a combination of volatility and synergist bioassays. In these studies, Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) was used as a model for other medically important dipterans. In addition to a susceptible strain (Canton-S), three mutant strains were tested that included a strain resistant by P450-based metabolism (Hikone-R) and two resistant neurological mutant strains; one voltage-gated sodium channel mutant (para(ts-1)) and one GABA-gated chloride channel mutant (Rdl). In general, the 11 tested insecticides displayed a diversity of toxicity, metabolism, and resistance characteristics that correlate with their structural diversity. Several important trends were revealed by these studies, including hydrolase- and cytochrome P450 (P450)-based activation, P450-based resistance, distinct patterns of neurological activity, and negative cross-resistance with established insecticides. These findings provide important insight into the metabolism and modes of action for the volatile insecticides. These findings also suggest potential approaches for insecticide deployment in integrated vector management and resistance management programs.
Insecticide susceptible/resistance status in Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti and Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) in Thailand during 2003-2005.	Susceptibility baselines and diagnostic doses of the technical grade insecticides deltamethrin, permethrin, fenitrothion, and propoxur were established based on Aedes aegypti (L.), Bora (French Polynesia), a reference susceptible strain. Field-collected Aedes mosquitoes from each part of Thailand were subjected to bioassay for their susceptibility to the diagnostic doses of each insecticide. Almost all Ae. aegypti collected were incipient resistant or resistant to deltamethrin and permethrin, except those from some areas of Songkhla (southern) and Phan district of Chiang Rai (northern) province. Susceptibility to fenitrothion was found in mosquitoes from Bangkok (central), Chonburi (eastern), Chiang Rai, Kanchanaburi (western), and Songkhla, whereas they were resistant in almost all areas of Nakhon Sawan (north central) and Nakhon Ratchasima (northeastern) provinces. Most of Ae. aegypti were susceptible to propoxur except those from Mae Wong, Nakhon Sawan province. Various levels of insecticide resistance and susceptibility in adjacent areas revealed a focal susceptible/resistance profile in the country. It could be noted that almost all of Ae. albopictus were susceptible to the insecticides tested at the same diagnostic doses. In conclusion, resistance to pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin) has developed in Ae. aegypti in most of the collected areas, suggesting that an alternative choice of insecticide or other control measures should be applied.
Evaluation of azinphos-methyl resistance and activity of detoxifying enzymes in codling moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) from central Chile.	Regular applications of insecticides have been the main management practice against codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in Chile. Organophosphates are the most widely used insecticides, and azinphos-methyl is an important element in spray programs. In particular, we evaluated diagnostic doses of azinphos-methyl on neonate and postdiapausing larvae from seven apple (Malus spp.) orchards. We also evaluated the activity of detoxifying enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), cytochrome P450 polysubstrate monooxygenases (PSMOs), and esterases, which are likely to be involved in resistance to insecticides. Such responses were compared with an insecticide-susceptible strain that has been maintained in the laboratory for several years. Neonate larval mortality of field populations to azinphos-methyl was not significantly different from of the susceptible strain. In contrast, postdiapause larval mortality was significantly lower in the six analyzed populations than in the susceptible strain. The C. pomonella populations with reduced postdiapause mortality to azinphos-methyl also showed statistically higher GST activity. Finally, no significant differences were found in total esterase or PSMO activity between C. pomonella populations. Therefore, the observed reduction in postdiapause larval mortality to azinphos-methyl seems to be associated with an increase in GST activity.
Suppressive potential of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) flour against five species of stored-product mites (Acari: Acarididae).	Previous research has demonstrated that legume proteins have insecticidal activity against stored-product pests, but activity against stored-product mites has not been tested. A study was therefore conducted to explore the potential of bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., flour as novel botanical acaricide against five species of storage and dust mites: Acarus siro L., Aleuroglyphus ovatus (Troupeau), Caloglyphus redickorzevi (Zachvatkin), Lepidoglyphus destructor (Schrank), and Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank). The effect of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., grain enriched with bean flour to eight concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10%) on population growth initiating from the density of 50 mites per 100 g of wheat was recorded for 21 d under laboratory conditions (grain moisture 14.6% moisture content and 25 degree C in darkness). The enrichment of grain with bean flour suppressed the population growth of all tested species: 0.01% concentration reduced population growth of all tested species to >50% in comparison with the control population. The most sensitive species were A. siro and L. destructor, followed by T. putrescentiae and C. redickorzevi. The least sensitive species was A. ovatus. The terminal (i.e., after 21 d) density of mites positively correlated with bean flour concentration. The suppressive effect of bean flour was not linear but rather asymptotic. The results of this study are discussed in the context of the application of bean flour in integrated control of stored-product mites and the elimination of stored-product mite allergens.
Influence of temperature and humidity on insecticidal effect of three diatomaceous earth formulations against larger grain borer (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae).	Laboratory experiments were carried out to evaluated three diatomaceous earth (DE) formulations--Protect-It, PyriSec (at dose rates 500, 1000, and 1500 ppm), and DEA-P (at dose rates 75, 150, and 500 ppm)--against the larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae), adults in stored maize, Zea mays L., at three temperatures (20, 25, and 30 degrees C) and two relative humidity (RH) levels (55 and 75%). At these conditions, the capability of progeny production in the treated substrate also was assessed. Adult survival was high, at all doses of Protect-It and PyriSec. Progeny production was also high. In contrast with the other two DEs, DEA-P was highly effective and caused complete mortality to the exposed P. truncatus adults, even at the lowest dose rate (75 ppm). In addition, progeny production was completely suppressed. Generally, Protect-it and PyriSec were more effective at 20 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. In contrast, the efficacy of DEA-P was continuously high in all temperatures and relative humidities examined.
Biocidal activity of three wood essential oils against Ixodes scapularis (Acari: Ixodidae), Xenopsylla cheopis (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae), and Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae).	The biocidal activity of three steam distilled wood essential oils-incense cedar, Calocedrus decurrens (Torr.) Florin; Port-Orford-cedar, Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (A. Murr.) Parl.; and western juniper, Juniperus occidentalis (Hook)--were evaluated against adult Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Xenopsylla cheopis (Rothchild) (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae) and nymphal Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae). In vitro laboratory bioassays were conducted to establish baseline dose-mortality data through 24 h. Incense cedar heartwood was the most toxic to all three vector species followed in order of activity by western juniper and Port-Orford-cedar based on LC50 and LC90 values. Ae. aegypti were substantially more susceptible to the oils than either I. scapularis or X. cheopis.
A two-generational reproductive toxicity study of zinc in rats.	A two-generation reproductive toxicity study of zinc chloride (ZnCl(2)) was conducted in rats. F(o) male and female rats were administered 0.00 (control), 7.50 (low), 15.00 (mid) and 30.00 (high) mg/kg/day of ZnCl(2). Selected F(1) male and female rats were exposed to the same doses received by their parents (F(o)). Exposure of F(0) parental rats to ZnCl(2) showed significant reduction in fertility, viability (days 0 and 4), and the body weight of F(1) pups from the high-dose group but caused no effects on litter size, weaning index, and sex ratio. Similarly, the continued exposure of F(1) parental rats to ZnCl(2) also reduced fertility, liter size, viability (day 0), and the body weight of F(2) pups within the high-dose group but caused no effects on weaning index and sex ratio. Exposure of ZnCl(2) to F(0) and F(1) parental males resulted in a significant reduction in their body weights, and the F(0) and F(1) parental females did not show any significant difference in their body weights compared to their control groups. However, the postpartum dam weights of both F(0) and F(1) female rats were significantly reduced compared to their controls. Exposure of ZnCl(2) to F(o) and F(1) generation parental rats did not produce any significant change of their clinical signs as well as their clinical pathology parameters, except the alkaline phosphotase (ALK) level, which showed an upward trend in both sexes of both generations. Exposure of ZnCl(2) to F(0) rats resulted in a reduction of brain, liver, kidney, spleen and seminal vesicles weights of males and in the spleen and uterus of females. Similarly, exposure of F(1) rats to ZnCl(2) also resulted in reduction of brain, liver, kidney, adrenal, spleen, prostate and seminal vesicles weights of males and in spleen and uterus of females. ZnCl(2) exposure resulted in grossly observed gastro-intestianla (GI) tract, lymphoreticular/hematopoietic, and reproductive tract lesions in parental rats in both generations. Reduced body fat was also recorded in F(1) parental rats.
Review of aquatic in situ approaches for stressor and effect diagnosis.	Field-based (in situ) approaches are used increasingly for measuring biological effects and for stressor diagnoses in aquatic systems because these assessment tools provide realistic exposure environments that are rarely replicated in laboratory toxicity tests. Providing realistic exposure scenarios is important because environmental conditions can alter toxicity through complex exposure dynamics (e.g., multiple stressor interactions). In this critical review, we explore the information provided by aquatic in situ exposure and monitoring methods when compared with more traditional approaches and discuss the associated strengths and limitations of these techniques. In situ approaches can, under some circumstances, provide more valuable information to a decision maker than information from surveys of resident biota, laboratory toxicity tests, or chemical analyses alone. A decision tree is provided to assist decision makers in determining when in situ approaches can add value.
In situ-based effects measures: considerations for improving methods and approaches.	In situ-based effects measures have gained increased acceptance as a means to improve the link between cause and effect in aquatic ecotoxicological studies. These approaches have primarily been employed where more conventional laboratory tests with field collected samples and routine in-field community surveys have failed to provide reasonable answers with respect to causes of toxicity, primary routes of contaminant exposure, and what constitutes ecotoxicologically relevant contaminant levels, at least at a site-specific level. One of the main advantages provided by in situ tests compared to more conventional field-based monitoring approaches is that they provide better control over stressor exposure to a defined population of test animals under natural or near-natural field conditions. In situ techniques can also be used to avoid artifacts related to sampling, transport and storage of contaminated water and sediment intended for laboratory-based toxicity assessment. In short, they can reduce the need for laboratory to field extrapolation and, when conducted properly, in situ tests can provide improved diagnostic ability and high ecological relevance. This paper provides suggestions and considerations for designing in situ studies, choosing test species and test endpoints, avoiding or minimizing test artifacts, best addressing some of the limitations of in situ test techniques, and generally improving the overall quality of the in situ approach chosen.
In situ methods of measurement--an important line of evidence in the environmental risk framework.	A tiered framework provides a structured approach to assess and manage risk and underpins much of the legislation concerning chemicals and environmental management. Management decisions regarding appropriate controls can have high cost implications to the regulated community. The risk framework provides an evidence-based approach to reduce uncertainty in decision making. Traditional assessment is heavily dependent on laboratory-generated toxicity test data and estimations of exposure and effect. Despite many well documented demonstrations of in situ methodologies, they are rarely used by regulators to help improve assessment or to validate risk. Emerging legislation puts greater emphasis on environmental outcomes and represents a significant shift from the reliance on chemical measures alone toward biological responses that improve assessment and demonstrate ecological benefit. Diagnostic methods, that could include in situ-based measures, will help assess and manage environments failing to achieve good status and it is likely that a weight of evidence approach will be needed to help inform management decisions. The potential application of such measures in the risk framework is reviewed in the context of current and emerging legislation concerning chemicals. Effect measures on the basis of in situ methods provide an alternative line of evidence and can help reduce uncertainty in decision making. Criteria are presented to help select appropriate methods in a multiple-line, weight of evidence approach.
Summary and recommendations from a SETAC Pellston Workshop on in situ measures of ecological effects.	The objective of a SETAC Pellston Workshop held in Portland, Oregon, USA, in November 2004 was to evaluate the use of field-based biological effects and exposure techniques in the hazard and risk assessment of aquatic ecosystems, thereby improving the accuracy and relevance of the decision-making process. This objective was addressed by keynote presentations outlining the state of the science and providing case studies, followed by work-group discussions focusing on 4 main areas: 1) Improving stressor-effect diagnostic capability in the assessment process; 2) maximizing efficiency, quality assurance and quality control, and broad-scale applicability of in situ field bioassays and experimental approaches; 3) determining the ecological relevance and consequences of individual and food chain-based effect measures; and 4) incorporating results from field-based effect methods into a weight-of-evidence decision-making process. Major outcomes from group discussions are highlighted, and future priorities for research in this area are recommended.
Environmental quality standards for water framework directive priority substances: challenges and opportunities.	The recently published Daughter Directive on priority substances is the culmination of several years of effort by the European Commission to develop consistent, Europe-wide environmental quality standards (EQS) that are scientifically based and protective of Europe's surface waters. This commentary describes progress to date in deriving EQS under the Water Framework Directive and identifies some remaining challenges and opportunities. In the Daughter Directive, annual average EQS are set for surface waters for all 33 priority substances. No sediment standards are included, and biota EQS are proposed for methyl-mercury, hexachlorobenzene and hexachlorobutadiene. Important remaining questions include whether the standard chemical risk assessment methodology is appropriate for deriving water column EQS and whether it would be appropriate to derive EQS for sediment or biota or to adopt alternative strategies. Moreover, some cross-cutting issues about the cessation of discharges of naturally occurring or ubiquitous substances and the advantages and disadvantages of member states setting their own EQS are briefly addressed.
Toxicological evaluation of Cladophora glomerata Kützing and Microspora floccosa Thuret in albino rats.	This study aimed to evaluate the toxicity of Cladophora glomerata and Microspora floccosa ethanolic extracts in rats. Acute toxicity was tested with a single oral administration of the extract at a dose of 25 g/kg bd wt. Mortality, behavior, amount of food intake, body weight, and any abnormalities of the visceral organs, were observed. The results showed that the extract caused neither mortality, nor abnormalities. Subchronic toxicity was tested by administering the extract at doses of 0.5 g/kg and 1.0 g/kg for 60 days. Differences in body weight, hematology and blood biochemistry (alanine aminotransferase, ALT; aspartate aminotransferase, AST; blood urea nitrogen, BUN and creatinine, Cre) were not detected among the control and treatment groups. Although the packed cell volume of the male rats treated with 1.0 g/kg extract was significantly lower than the controls (p< or =0.05), the level was in the standard range for rat hematocrit.
Effect of Kaempferia parviflora Wall. ex. Baker on sexual activity of male rats and its toxicity.	Kaempferia parviflora Wall. Ex. Baker (Krachaidum) has long been used among Thai men for sexual enhancement. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of K. parviflora ethanolic extract on the sexual behavior of male rats and its toxicity. The experiment was divided into three groups of rats given K. parviflora extract at doses of 60, 120, and 240 mg/kg BW for 60 days, whilst a control group received distilled water at 1 ml/day per oral. The results showed that all groups of male rats had significantly higher courtship behavior during the first 10-minute period of observation than in the 2nd and 3rd 10-minute periods, except those receiving the highest dose of K. parviflora. They revealed the same amount of courtship behavior throughout a whole 30-minute period, which was significantly lower than the control group. There was no significant difference between treated and control groups in other sexual behaviors; mount frequency (MF), intromission frequency (IF), mount latency (ML), or intromission latency (IL). Toxicological study revealed no significant difference of hemoglobin, WBC or differential cell count. All dosages had no effect on kidney and liver function, according to the normal values of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Crea), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Nevertheless, the histopathological study showed a morphological change in the liver. It was concluded that K. parviflora extract at 240 mg/kg BW reduced the time in the first 10 mintues of rat courtship behavior and the use of high and chronic doses of K. parviflora in humans should be considered inadvisable.
Model systems for study of toxic injury of hepatocytes in vitro]	The liver is a common target of toxic effect of a number of xenobiotics, which is in particular a result of its central role in intermediary and energetic metabolism and in biotransformation processes. Ethical, economic, legislative, research and other reasons do not allow testing all of newly-synthesized compounds in in vivo conditions. Hence new methods and approaches for hepatotoxicity testing in vitro have been developing. The most important systems for study of toxicity and metabolic activity in vitro are isolated perfused liver, liver slices, isolated liver cells in suspensions or in primary cultures including co-culture methods and special 3D techniques, various subcellular fractions and stabilised cell lines. These models can be used for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity screening, evaluation of potential hepatoprotective capacity of different compounds, study of toxic injury and characterization of hepatotoxicity mechanisms. Currently there is no an ideal in vitro liver model system for testing of hepatotoxic substances in vitro, nevertheless use of these model systems reduces economic costs and ethic and legislative problems. Model systems in vitro afford opportunity to study in detail mechanisms of hepatotoxicity in comparison with in vivo conditions. Definition of their actual advantages and disadvantages allows choosing a suitable model system for study of particular problem. We cannot imagine current research of liver toxicity without using these model sytems.
Acceptance criteria for levels of hydrazine in substances for pharmaceutical use and analytical methods for its determination.	This report includes a brief review of the toxicology of hydrazine and the strategies used to set acceptance criteria. A preliminary examination of a number of approaches to determine hydrazine in pharmaceutical substances susceptible to its presence either as residue from the synthesis or from decomposition are described.
Assessment of coastal pollution through bioassay and transplantation of intertidal clams.	In the present study, a survey of Mahim creek and Bay area was undertaken that indicated absence of fauna, particularly molluscs from the area, which was a repository in the past. During bioassay experiments of Mahim creek water, the clams G. divaricatum and C. antiquata could not open their valves in 100% creek water and died within 12 hrs of exposure. The 96 hrs LC50 values of Mahim creek water for G. divaricatum and C. antiquata were found to be 20% and 40% respectively during summer and 38% and 57% respectively during rainy season. When two sets of the clams were transplanted at Mahim creek, they died within 12 hrs. These experiments suggest the extreme level of pollution in the area. This level of pollution is responsible for transforming the area into barren locality in terms of fauna, specially the rich molluscan diversity. However, Gorai creek was found to be comparatively very less polluted and it still serves as breeding and nursery ground for various fishes and prawn species. Hence it must be protected and conserved.
Anticancer activity of a peptide combination in gastrointestinal cancers targeting multiple neuropeptide receptors.	A novel peptide combination consisting of four synthetic neuropeptide analogs of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP), Bombesin, Substance P and Somatostatin has been found to have potent anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. The receptors of these four neuropeptides are known to be over expressed in various cancers. We have found the presence of native neuropeptides in the culture supernatant of the primary tumor cells of human colon adenocarcinomas. It was further demonstrated by receptor-ligand assays that not only do these tumor cells synthesize and secrete four peptide hormones but also possess specific high affinity receptors on their surface. Screening a large panel of analogs to the four peptide hormones on tumor cell proliferation led to the identification of four cytotoxic analogs, the combination of which was code-named DRF7295. The design and synthesis of the peptide analogs have been described in this paper. In vitro anticancer activity of DRF7295 was studied in a large panel of human tumor cells. Gastrointestinal tumor cells of the colon, pancreas and duodenum were found to be most sensitive to DRF7295 with moderate activity seen in glioblastoma, prostate, leukemia and those of oral cancer cells. Efficacy studies in xenograft models of colon and duodenum resulted in T/C% of less than 40%, which is indicative of strong tumor regressing potential of DRF7295 in gastrointestinal cancers. Acute and long-term toxicity studies as well as safety pharmacology studies conducted indicate the safety of the drug upon systemic administration with no significant adverse pharmacological effects.
Bioassessment of a combined chemical-biological treatment for synthetic acid mine drainage.	In this work, ecotoxicological characteristics of synthetic samples of acid mine drainage (AMD) before and after a combined chemical-biological treatment were investigated by using Lepidium sativum and Daphnia magna. AMD treatment was performed in a two-column apparatus consisting of chemical precipitation by limestone and biological refinement by sulphate reducing bacteria. Synthetic samples of AMD before treatment were toxic for both L. sativum (germination index, G, lower than 10%) and D. magna (100% immobility) due to acid pH and presence of copper and zinc. Chemical treatment (raising pH to 5-6 and eliminating copper) generated effluents with reduced toxicity for L. sativum (G=33%), while 100% immobility was still observed for D. magna. Dynamic trends of toxicity for the first and fifth outputs of the biological column denoted a gradual improvement leading to hormesis for Lepidium (after the initial release of organic excess), while a constant residual toxicity remained for Daphnia (probably due to H(2)S produced by sulphate reducing bacteria).
Caenorhabditis elegans: an emerging model in biomedical and environmental toxicology.	The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as an important animal model in various fields including neurobiology, developmental biology, and genetics. Characteristics of this animal model that have contributed to its success include its genetic manipulability, invariant and fully described developmental program, well-characterized genome, ease of maintenance, short and prolific life cycle, and small body size. These same features have led to an increasing use of C. elegans in toxicology, both for mechanistic studies and high-throughput screening approaches. We describe some of the research that has been carried out in the areas of neurotoxicology, genetic toxicology, and environmental toxicology, as well as high-throughput experiments with C. elegans including genome-wide screening for molecular targets of toxicity and rapid toxicity assessment for new chemicals. We argue for an increased role for C. elegans in complementing other model systems in toxicological research.
Safety pharmacology assessment of central nervous system function in juvenile and adult rats: effects of pharmacological reference compounds.	Recent EU/US pediatric legislation and FDA/EMEA guidelines recognize the potential differences in safety profiles of drugs in adults versus young patients. Hence safety studies are recommended to investigate key functional domains of e.g. the developing CNS.
The influence of small-scale circum-neutral pH change on Cu-bioavailability and toxicity to an estuarine bivalve (Austriella cf plicifera) in whole-sediment toxicity tests.	In whole-sediment toxicity tests employing metal-spiked sediment, pH is a crucial determinant of sediment geochemistry, sediment-porewater metal partitioning and metal bioavailability to benthic organisms. Small pH changes in metal-spiked sediment may therefore have important implications for toxicity to organisms. The present study evaluated the effect of small-scale pH changes (pH 6.6, 7.2, 7.6) in Cu-spiked sediment on metal bioavailability and subsequent organism response. Variation of pH produced distinct changes in sediment geochemistry. Increasing pH from 6.6 to 7.6 resulted in lower redox potential, greater acid volatile sulfide (AVS) formation, and lower partitioning of Cu, Fe and Mn to the porewater. The minor pH changes and associated variation in sediment geochemistry modified reburial rates and copper accumulation by the bivalve, Austriella cf plicifera. Bivalve reburial was slowest for the 1400 microg g(-1) Cu-spiked pH 6.6 sediment, in which porewater copper concentrations exceeded 50 microg L(-1). Bivalve reburial was higher for pH 7.2 Cu-spiked sediments at all concentrations of copper investigated than in pH 6.6 and 7.6 sediments, where reburial rates were similar. Higher levels of bivalve activity suggest that A. cf plicifera may have an optimal pH range in the vicinity of pH 7.2. Tissue Cu concentrations varied with pH and appear dependent on spiked Cu concentration and organism activity. Strong linear correlations of tissue Cu concentration with all three Cu phases (overlying water, porewater and particulate phases), however, limited the ability to accurately determine the source of Cu uptake.
Toxicology profiles of a novel p53-armed replication-competent oncolytic adenovirus in rodents, felids, and nonhuman primates.	Conditionally replicating adenovirus (CRAd) has demonstrated to be safe in clinical studies. We generated a triple-regulated p53-armed CRAd, SG600-p53, in which the partially deleted E1a and E1b genes are regulated under the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter and the hypoxia response element. SG600-p53 was proven to be effective both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, the preclinical safety profiles of SG600-p53 in animal models were investigated. SG600-p53 had no adverse effects on mouse behavioral and nervous systems at 1.0 x 10(11) viral particles (VP)/kg, 2.0 x 10(11) VP/kg and 4.0 x 10(11) VP/kg doses, and on cat cardiovascular and respiratory systems at 2.0 x 10(10) VP/kg, 4.0 x 10(10) VP/kg, and 8.0 x 10(10) VP/kg doses. In acute toxicity test in mice, the maximum tolerated dose (2.5 x 10(13) VP/kg) induced cachexia, decreased activity, and eye closure in 9/20 mice which could be self-resolved within 30 min. Sensitized by five repeated ip injections at 1.0 x 10(10) VP/kg each ip and excitated by one iv injection at 1.0 x 10(11) VP/kg, guinea pigs did not show any sign of systemic anaphylaxis. In repeat-dose toxicological studies, the no-observable-adverse-effect levels of SG600-p53 in rats (1.0 x 10(11) VP/kg) and cynomolgus monkeys (5.0 x 10(11) VP/kg) were 12-fold and 60-fold of the proposed clinical dose, respectively. Intramuscular injections of SG600-p53 in cynomolgus monkeys caused inflammation at injection sites, which was alleviative at the end of observation period. The anti-virus antibody was produced in animal sera and decreased gradually 4 weeks later. No histopathological changes were found by bone marrow examination. Our data in different animal models suggest that SG600-p53 is a safe antitumor therapeutic agent.
Cogniauxia podolaena: bioassay-guided fractionation of defoliated stems, isolation of active compounds, antiplasmodial activity and cytotoxicity.	COGNIAUXIA PODOLAENA Baill. (Cucurbitaceae) is traditionally used in Congo Brazzaville for the treatment of malaria. We assessed the antiplasmodial activity of the plant and isolated some of the compounds responsible for this activity. It was the first time that a chemical study of this plant has been undertaken. Three triterpenes were isolated: cucurbitacin B ( 1), cucurbitacin D ( 2) and 20-epibryonolic acid ( 3) and their structures were assigned from spectroscopic evidence and comparison with published data. The crystallographic structure of 3 was determined. All fractions and compounds obtained in this study were assayed for antiplasmodial activity (on FcM29, a chloroquine-resistant strain of P. FALCIPARUM) and cytotoxicity (on KB and Vero cell lines). The IC50 values of 1, 2 and 3 are 1.6, 4 and 2 microg/mL on FcM29. Both 1 and 2 have a high cytotoxicity whereas 3 shows a better selectivity index.
Embryotoxicity hazard assessment of cadmium and arsenic compounds using embryonic stem cells.	The Embryonic Stem Cell Test (EST) has been successfully validated as an in vitro method for detecting embryotoxicity, showing a good overall test accuracy of 78% [Genschow, E., Spielmann, H., Scholz, G., Seiler, A., Brown, N., Piersma, A., Brady, M., Clemann, N., Huuskonen, H., Paillard, F., Bremer, S., Becker, K., 2002. The ECVAM international validation study on in vitro embryotoxicity tests: results of the definitive phase and evaluation of prediction models. European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods. Altern. Lab. Anim. 30, 151-176]. Methylmercury was the only strong in vivo embryotoxicant falsely predicted as non-embryotoxic making the metal the most significant outlayer [Genschow, E., Spielmann, H., Scholz, G., Pohl, I., Seiler, A., Clemann, N., Bremer, S., Becker, K., 2004. Validation of the Embryonic Stem Cell Test in the international ECVAM validation study on three in vitro embryotoxicity tests. Altern. Lab. Anim. 32, 209-244]. The misclassification of methylmercury and the potential environmental exposure to developmental toxic heavy metals promoted our investigation of whether the EST applicability domain covers cadmium and arsenic compounds. The EST misclassified cadmium, arsenite and arsenate compounds as non-embryotoxic, even when including arsenic metabolites (methylarsonate, methylarsonous and dimethylarsinic). The reasons were the lack of higher cytotoxicity towards embryonic stem cells as compared to more mature cells (3T3 fibroblasts) or the absence of inhibition of cardiac differentiation by specific mechanisms rather than general cytotoxicity. Including EST data on heavy metals from the literature (lithium, methylmercury, trivalent chromium and hexavalent chromium) revealed that the test correctly predicted the embryotoxic potential of three out of the seven heavy metals, indicating an insufficient predictivity for such metals. Refinement of the EST prediction model and inclusion of additional toxicological endpoints could expand the applicability domain and enhance the predictive power of the test.
Flavonoids from Iris songarica and their antioxidant and estrogenic activity.	A new dihydroflavonol, songaricol ( 1) and seven known flavonoids, ayamenin A ( 2), irisflavone A ( 3), 5,7-dihydroxy-2',6-dimethoxyisoflavone ( 4), irilin B ( 5), 5,3'-dihydroxy-7,8,2'-trimethoxyisoflavone ( 6) and irisoid A ( 7) were isolated from rhizome and roots of IRIS SONGARICA. Structure elucidation of 1 was achieved through extensive NMR and circular dichroism techniques. Compounds 1, 5 and 7 showed antioxidant activity in HL-60 cells (IC50 values of 21, 11 and 3.8 microg/mL), whereas 2, 5 and the previously isolated irisone B were able to show estrogenic response (EC50 values of 305.5, 159.7 and 322.0 microg/mL) in yeast cells expressing human estrogen receptor (ER-alpha).

Mode of action-based classification and prediction of activity of uncouplers for the screening of chemical inventories.	A new approach for classification of uncouplers of oxidative and photophosphorylation, also suitable for screening of large chemical inventories, is introduced. Earlier fragment-based approaches for this mode of toxic action are limited to phenols but weak acids of extremely diverse chemical classes can act as uncouplers. The proposed approach overcomes the limitation to phenolic uncouplers by combining structural fragments with the global information of physico-chemical descriptors. In a top-down approach to reduce the number of candidate chemicals, firstly substructure definitions for the detection of weak acids were applied. Subsequently, conservative physico-chemical thresholds for the two most important properties for the uncoupling activity were defined: an acid dissociation constant (pK(a)) between 3 and 9, and a sufficiently low energy barrier for the internal permeability of anions (17 kcal/mol). The later was derived from a novel approach to calculate the distribution of compounds across membranes. The combination of structural and physico-chemical criteria allowed a good separation of active from inactive chemicals with high sensitivity (95%) and slightly lower (more than 75%) specificity. Applying this approach to several thousand high and low production volume chemicals retrieved a surprisingly small number of 10 compounds with a predicted excess toxicity above 10. Nevertheless, uncoupling can be an important mode of action as highlighted with several examples ranging from pesticide metabolites to persistent organic compounds.
An evaluation of the implementation of the Cramer classification scheme in the Toxtree software.	Risk assessment for most human health effects is based on the threshold of a toxicological effect, usually derived from animal experiments. The Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) is a concept that refers to the establishment of a level of exposure for all chemicals below which there would be no appreciable risk to human health. When carefully applied, the TTC concept can provide a means of waiving testing based on knowledge of exposure limits. Two main approaches exist; the first of these is a General Threshold of Toxicological Concern; the second approach is a TTC in relation to structural information and/or toxicological data of chemicals. The structural scheme most routinely used is that of Cramer and co-workers from 1978. Recently this scheme was encoded into a software program called Toxtree, specifically commissioned by the European Chemicals Bureau (ECB). Here we evaluate two published datasets using Toxtree to demonstrate its concordance and highlight potential software modifications. The results were promising with an overall good concordance between the reported classifications and those generated by Toxtree. Further evaluation of these results highlighted a number of inconsistencies which were examined in turn and rationalised as far as possible. Improvements for Toxtree were proposed where appropriate. Notable of these is a necessity to update the lists of common food components and normal body constituents as these accounted for the majority of false classifications observed. Overall Toxtree was found to be a useful tool in facilitating the systematic evaluation of compounds through the Cramer scheme.
Identification of mechanisms of toxic action for skin sensitisation using a SMARTS pattern based approach.	Skin sensitisation is a key endpoint under REACH as it is costly and its assessment currently has a high dependency on animal testing. In order to reduce both the cost and the numbers of animals tested, it is likely that (quantitative) structure-activity relationships ((Q)SAR) and read-across methods will be utilised as part of intelligent testing strategies. The majority of skin sensitisers elicit their effect via covalent bond formation with skin proteins. These reactions have been understood in terms of well defined nucleophilic-electrophilic reaction chemistry. Thus, a first step in (Q)SAR analysis is the assignment of a chemical's potential mechanism of action enabling it to be placed in an appropriate reactivity domain. The aim of this study was to design a series of SMARTS patterns capable of defining these reactivity domains. This was carried out using a large database of local lymph node assay (LLNA) results that had had potential mechanisms of action assigned to them using expert knowledge. A simple algorithm was written enabling the SMARTS patterns to be used to screen a database of SMILES strings. The SMARTS patterns were then evaluated using a second, smaller, test set of LLNA results which had also had potential mechanisms of action assigned by experts. The results showed that the SMARTS patterns provided an excellent method of identifying potential electrophilic mechanisms. The findings are supported, in part, by molecular orbital calculations which confirm assignment of reactive mechanism of action. The ability to define a chemical's potential reaction mechanism is likely to be of significant benefit to regulators and risk assessors as it enables category formation and subsequent read-across to be performed.
No long-term persistence of bacterial pollution-induced community tolerance in tylosin-polluted soil.	Pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) of soil bacteria to the antibiotic tylosin was studied over 95 days. Tylosin was added at increasing concentrations, together with different amounts of alfalfa to study the effects of substrate addition on PICT and bacterial growth in soil. The leucine incorporation technique was used to estimate bacterial growth and as a detection method in the PICT concept. Direct inhibition of the bacterial growth rates, resulting in a dose-response curve, was found above 50 mg of tylosin kg(-1) of soil two days after tylosin addition (IC50 value of 960 mg tylosin kg(-1)). After 10 days of exposure to at least 50 mg of tylosin kg(-1), the PICT was observed and correlated to inhibition of bacterial growth by tylosin. A return of the PICT to control levels was found over time, and after 95 days at 1500 mg of tylosin kg(-1), essentially no PICT was found, as compared to the unpolluted control soil. The return of PICT to pre-exposure levels was not totally reflected in the recovery of bacterial growth. Alfalfa addition did not affect the inhibitory effect of tylosin on bacterial growth rates; neither did it alter the PICT. Since tylosin is relatively rapidly degraded in soil, our results indicate that the PICT will return to prepollution levels when the selective pressure of the toxicant is removed and will thus be a useful technique for monitoring remediation measures.
Statewide investigation of the role of pyrethroid pesticides in sediment toxicity in California's urban waterways.	A statewide investigation of urban creek sediment toxicity was conducted in California in recognition of increased incidences of toxicity linked to pyrethroid pesticides. The goals were to examine the spatial occurrence and magnitude of sediment toxicity in California urban creeks, and to examine the role of pyrethroids in toxic urban creek sediment samples. After a preliminary screening of 90 sites, 30 creeks were sampled in eight geographical regions. Sediment toxicity was assessed using 10 day bioassays with the resident amphipod Hyalella azteca. Bioassays were conducted at two test temperatures of 23 degrees C and at 15 degrees C to provide evidence of the cause of toxicity, and to more accurately reflect ambient environmental temperatures. Twenty-five of 30 samples were toxic when tested at 23 degrees C, and all 30 samples were toxic when tested at 15 degrees C. The magnitude of toxicity increased in samples tested at 15 degrees C suggesting the influence of pyrethroids, which are more toxic at colder temperatures. Pyrethroids were present in all sediment samples and were the only compounds detected at concentrations toxic to H. azteca. Bifenthrin was the pyrethroid of greatest toxicological concern, occurring in all 30 samples at concentrations up to 219 ng/g. Pyrethroid contamination of urban creeks was most severe in the Los Angeles, Central Valley, and San Diego regions, respectively. However, pyrethroids were also linked to urban creek aquatic toxicity in all regions sampled, including the less urbanized areas of the North Coast and Lake Tahoe.
Interaction of nano-TiO2 with lysozyme: insights into the enzyme toxicity of nanosized particles.	Nanomaterials have been used increasingly in industrial production and daily life, but their human exposure may cause health risks. The interactions of nanomaterial with functional biomolecules are often applied as a precondition for its cytotoxicity and organ toxicity where various proteins have been investigated in the past years. In the present study, nano-TiO(2) was selected as the representative of nanomaterials and lysozyme as a representative for enzymes. By investigating their interaction by various instrumentations, the objective is to identify the action sites and types, estimate the effect on the enzyme structure and activity, and reveal the toxicity mechanism of nanomaterial.
Evaluation of surface water quality using an ecotoxicological approach: a case study of the Alqueva Reservoir (Portugal).	Freshwater reservoirs can be impacted by several hazardous substances through inputs from agricultural activity, sewage discharges, and groundwater leaching and runoff. The water quality assessment is very important for implementation of the monitoring and remediation programs to minimize the risk promoted by hazardous substances in aquatic ecosystems. Evaluation of the degree of contamination of aquatic environments must not take in account only its chemical characterization but it must be complemented with biological assays, which determine potential toxic effects and allows an integrated evaluation of its effects in populations and aquatic ecosystem communities. The application of this type of strategy has clear advantages allowing a general evaluation of the effects from all the water components, including those due to unknown substances and synergic, antagonistic, or additive effects. There are only a few studies that reported ecotoxicological acute end points, for the assessment of surface water quality, and the relationship among toxicity results and the anthropogenic pollution sources and the seasonal period. The aim of this study was to assess the ecotoxicological characterization of the surface water from Alqueva reservoir (South of Portugal) and to evaluate the influence of anthropogenic sources of pollution and their seasonal variation in its toxicity. The construction of Alqueva reservoir was recently finished (2002) and, to our knowledge, an ecotoxicological assessment of its surface water has not been performed. Because of that, no information is available on the possible impact of pollutants on the biota. The surface water toxicity was assessed using acute and chronic bioassays. The results are to be used for developing a monitoring program, including biological methods.
Assessment of water quality in the Alqueva Reservoir (Portugal) using bioassays.	Alqueva Reservoir is the biggest artificial freshwater reservoir in Europe and is an important water supply for human and agricultural consumption in the Alentejo region (Portugal). Pollution can impair environmental and human health status, and to assure water quality and ecological balance, it is crucial to frequently monitor water supplies. In this study, we used an ecotoxicological test battery to identify the potential toxicity of water from this reservoir.
Influence of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) on the structure of Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria communities in a soil microcosm.	Linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) is the most used anionic surfactant in a worldwide scale and is considered a high-priority pollutant. LAS is regarded as a readily biodegradable product under aerobic conditions in aqueous media and is mostly removed in wastewater treatment plants, but an important fraction (20-25%) is immobilized in sewage sludge and persists under anoxic conditions. Due to the application of the sludge as a fertilizer, LAS reaches agricultural soil, and therefore, microbial toxicity tests have been widely used to evaluate the influence of LAS on soil microbial ecology. However, molecular-based community-level analyses have been seldom applied in studies regarding the effects of LAS on natural or engineered systems, and, to our knowledge, there are no reports of their use for such appraisals in agricultural soil. In this study, a microcosm system is used to evaluate the effects of a commercial mixture of LAS on the community structure of Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria in an agricultural soil.
Toxicity of methanol and formaldehyde towards Saccharomyces cerevisiae as assessed by DNA microarray analysis.	To assess the toxicity of the C1 compounds methanol and formaldehyde, gene expression profiles of treated baker's yeast were analyzed using DNA microarrays. Among approximately 6,000 open reading frames (ORFs), 314 were repressed and 375 were induced in response to methanol. The gene process category "energy" comprised the greatest number of induced genes while "protein synthesis" comprised the greatest number of repressed genes. Products of genes induced by methanol were mainly integral membrane proteins or were localized to the plasma membrane. A total of 622 and 610 ORFs were induced or repressed by formaldehyde, respectively. More than one-third of the genes found to be strongly repressed by formaldehyde belonged to the "protein synthesis" functional category. Conversely, genes in the subcategory of "nitrogen, sulfur, and selenium metabolism" within "metabolism" and in the category of "cell rescue, defense, and virulence" were up-regulated by exposure to formaldehyde. Our data suggest that membrane structure is a major target of methanol toxicity, while proteins were major targets of formaldehyde toxicity.
Evaluation of acute copper toxicity to juvenile freshwater mussels (fatmucket, Lampsilis siliquoidea) in natural and reconstituted waters.	The influence of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and water composition on the toxicity of copper to juvenile freshwater mussels (fatmucket, Lampsilis siliquoidea) were evaluated in natural and reconstituted waters. Acute 96-h copper toxicity tests werec onducted at four nominal DOC concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/L as carbon [C]) in dilutions of natural waters and in American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) reconstituted hard water. Toxicity tests also were conducted in ASTM soft, moderately hard, hard, and very hard reconstituted waters (nominal hardness 45-300 mg/L as CaCO₃). Three natural surface waters (9.5-11 mg/L DOC) were diluted to obtain a series of DOC concentrations with diluted well water, and an extract of natural organic matter and commercial humic acid was mixed with ASTM hard water to prepare a series of DOC concentrations for toxicity testing. Median effective concentrations (EC50s) for dissolved copper varied >40-fold (9.9 to >396 gg Cu/L) over all 21 treatments in various DOC waters. Within a particular type of DOC water, EC50s increased 5- to 12-fold across DOC concentrations of 0.3 to up to 11 mg C/L. However, EC50s increased by only a factor of 1.4 (21-30 gg Cu/L) in the four ASTM waters with wide range of water hardness (52-300 mg CaCO₃/L). Predictions from the biotic ligand model (BLM) for copper explained nearly 90% of the variability in EC50s. Nearly 70% of BLM-normalized EC50s for fatmucket tested in natural waters were below the final acute value used to derive the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency acute water quality criterion for copper, indicating that the criterion might not be protective of fatmucket and perhaps other mussel species.
Sublethal effects and predator-prey interactions: implications for ecological risk assessment.	Ecological risk assessments tend to focus on contaminant effects on single species in isolation. However, additional effects from interactions between species (e.g., predator-prey interactions) may also occur in natural systems. The present study investigated the consequences of sublethal contaminant effects in prey on predator-prey interactions, particularly the interaction between prey behavioral changes and predation by predators with different hunting strategies. Ambush (Ischnura elegans Vander Linden [Insecta, Odonata]) and active (Notonecta glauca Linnaeus [Insecta, Heteroptera]) predator species were used in conjunction with three prey species (Asellus aquaticus Linnaeus [Crustacea, Isopoda], Cloion dipterum Linnaeus [Insecta, Ephemeroptera], and Chironomus riparius Meigen [Insecta, Diptera]). Immobilized prey demonstrated the importance of prey behavior for determining predation rates for both single- and multiple-prey species. Chironomus riparius was less responsive following exposure to cadmium, becoming more vulnerableto attack by the active but not the ambush predator. Some evidence was also observed for reduced general activity in C. dipterum following cadmium exposure. Sublethal exposure of prey did not affect the prey choice of active predators, possibly because of prey behavioral changes being insufficient to influence their relative availabilities. However, cadmium exposure of prey did alter their susceptibility to ambush predators. There was a reduced proportion of C. dipterum and an increased proportion of A. aquaticus in the diet of ambush predators, possibly because of reduced activity in C. dipterum affecting their relative encounter rates with predators. Sublethal exposures can therefore result in reduced prey survival that would not be predicted by single-species toxicity tests.
Estimation of human maximum tolerable intake  for methylmercury based on two recent studies in monkeys.	Results of long-term toxicity studies of methylmercury (MeHg) in monkeys have been reported. The aim of this study was to estimate the threshold body burden, blood level and threshold daily intake (TDI) of MeHg for monkey and human. The concepts of this study stood on that body burden of MeHg would follow the accumulation theory, and that the more intake of MeHg, the earlier the neurotoxicity appeared, vice versa. The threshold blood level (TBL) of monkey was estimated to be 0.71 as Hg mg/L and the body burden was estimated to be 4.83 as Hg mg/kg. The TDI was estimated to be 0.025 as Hg mg/kg day. In human, the TBL was estimated with compensation by elimination constants of human and monkey. The blood threshold limit and TDI of human were estimated to be 0.33 as Hg mg/L and 0.0046 as Hg mg/kg day, respectively. The estimated body burden was 0.46 as Hg mg/kg.
Bayesian multilevel discrete interval hazard analysis to predict dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene mortality in Hyalella azteca based on body residues.	We exposed Hyalella azteca to p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene for intervals of 1 to 4 d and followed mortality out to 10 d. Mortality was determined as the cessation of heartbeat; dead organism body residue was determined daily. To model mortality probability, body residues of the living organisms were estimated using published kinetic data with concentration-dependent rate constants. The estimated residues compared favorably with measured residues in the dead organisms (predicted body residue = 1.302 ± 0.142 measured body residue + 10.351 ± 15.766, r² = 0.64, n = 50). The response data were collected at discrete intervals; thus, it was not possible to determine the exact time of death for organisms. Consequently, we analyzed the mortality data using discrete interval analysis, in a Bayesian hierarchical framework, with body residue as the dose metric. The predicted body residues to produce mortality were similar across the duration of exposure when postexposure mortality was considered. The concentration for 50% mortality was 0.47 μmol/g (148.6 tg/g, range 0.32-0.66 μmol/g), and predictions of response indicted 95% (range 73-99.9%) mortality at 0.79 μmol/g (250 μg/g) and 4% (range 1.2-9.6%) mortality at 0.16 μmol/g (50 μg/g). The lethal residue for 50% mortality based on interval analysis for short-term exposures with postexposure mortality resulted in values similar to long-term continuous exposures for exposure durations of more than 600 h.
Assessing the in vitro toxicity of the lunar dust environment  using respiratory cells exposed to Al(2)O(3) or SiO(2)  fine dust particles.	Prior chemical and physical analysis of lunar soil suggests a composition of dust particles that may contribute to the development of acute and chronic respiratory disorders. In this study, fine Al(2)O(3) (0.7 μm) and fine SiO(2) (mean 1.6 μm) were used to assess the cellular uptake and cellular toxicity of lunar dust particle analogs. Respiratory cells, murine alveolar macrophages (RAW 264.7) and human type II epithelial (A549), were cultured as the in vitro model system. The phagocytic activity of both cell types using ultrafine (0.1 μm) and fine (0.5 μm) fluorescent polystyrene beads was determined. Following a 6-h exposure, RAW 264.7 cells had extended pseudopods with beads localized in the cytoplasmic region of cells. After 24 h, the macrophage cells were rounded and clumped and lacked pseudopods, which suggest impairment of phagocytosis. A549 cells did not contain beads, and after 24 h, the majority of the beads appeared to primarily coat the surface of the cells. Next, we investigated the cellular response to fine SiO(2) and Al(2)O(3) (up to 5 mg/ml). RAW 264.7 cells exposed to 1.0 mg/ml of fine SiO(2) for 6 h demonstrated pseudopods, cellular damage, apoptosis, and necrosis. A549 cells showed slight toxicity when exposed to fine SiO(2) for the same time and dose. A549 cells had particles clustered on the surface of the cells. Only a higher dose (5.0 mg/ml) of fine SiO(2) resulted in a significant cytotoxicity to A549 cells. Most importantly, both cell types showed minimal cytotoxicity following exposure to fine Al(2)O(3). Overall, this study suggests differential cellular toxicity associated with exposure to fine mineral dust particles.
Pharmacological characterization of cis-nitromethylene neonicotinoids in relation to imidacloprid binding sites in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens.	Neonicotinoid insecticides, such as imidacloprid, are selective agonists of the insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and extensively used in areas of crop protection and animal health to control a variety of insect pest species. Here we describe that two cis-nitromethylene neonicotinoids (IPPA152002 and IPPA152004), recently synthesized in our laboratory, discriminated between the high and low affinity imidacloprid binding sites in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, a major insect pest of rice crops in many parts of Asia. [(3)H]imidacloprid has two binding sites with different affinities (Kd value of 0.0035 +/- 0.0006 nM for the high-affinity site and 1.47 +/- 0.22 nM for the low-affinity site). Although the cis-nitromethylene neonicotinoids showed low displacement ability (Ki values of 0.15 +/- 0.03 microM and 0.42 +/- 0.07 microM for IPPA152002 and IPPA152004, respectively) against [(3)H]imidacloprid binding, low concentrations (0.01 microM) of IPPA152002 completely inhibited [(3)H]imidacloprid binding at its high-affinity site. In Xenopus oocytes co-injected with cRNA encoding Nlalpha1 and rat beta2 subunits, obvious inward currents were detected in response to applications of IPPA152002 and IPPA152004, although the agonist potency is reduced to that of imidacloprid. The previously identified Y151S mutation in Nlalpha1 showed significant effects on the agonist potency of IPPA152002 and IPPA152004, such as a 75.8% and 70.6% reduction in Imax, and a 2.4- and 2.1-fold increase in EC(50). This data clearly shows that the two newly described cis-nitromethylene neonicotinoids act on insect nAChRs and like imidacloprid, discriminated between high and low affinity binding sites in N. lugens native nAChRs. These compounds may be useful tools to further elucidate the pharmacology and nature of neonicotinoid binding sites.
Environmental fate and toxicity of ionic liquids: a review.	Ionic liquids (ILs) are organic salts with low melting point that are being considered as green replacements for industrial volatile organic compounds. The reputation of these solvents as "environmental friendly" chemicals is based primarily on their negligible vapor pressure. Nonetheless, the solubility of ILs in water and a number of literature documenting toxicity of ILs to aquatic organisms highlight a real cause for concern. The knowledge of ILs behavior in the terrestrial environment, which includes microbial degradation, sorption and desorption, is equally important since both soil and aquatic milieu are possible recipients of IL contamination. This article reviews the achievements and current status of environmental risk assessment of ILs, and hopefully provides insights into this research frontier.
Removal of micropollutants and reduction of biological activity in a full scale reclamation plant using ozonation and activated carbon filtration.	Pharmaceutical compounds are found in secondary treated effluents up to microg L(-1) levels and therefore discharged into surface waters. Since the long term effects of these compounds on the environment and human health are, to date, largely unknown, implementation of advanced treatment of wastewaters is envisaged to reduce their discharge. This is of particular relevance where surface waters are used as drinking water sources and when considering indirect potable reuse. This study aimed at assessing the removal of organic micropollutants and the concurrent reduction of their biological activity in a full scale reclamation plant treating secondary effluent. The treatment consists of 6 stages: denitrification, pre-ozonation, coagulation/flocculation/dissolved air flotation and filtration (DAFF), main ozonation, activated carbon filtration and final ozonation for disinfection. For that purpose, representative 24-hour composite samples were collected after each stage. The occurrence of 85 compounds was monitored by LC/MS-MS. A battery of 6 bioassays was also used as a complementary tool to evaluate non-specific toxicity and 5 specific toxic modes of action. Results show that, among the 54 micropollutants quantified in the influent water, 50 were removed to below their limit of quantification representing more than 90% of concentration reduction. Biological activity was reduced, depending on the specific response that was assessed, from a minimum of 62% (AhR response) to more than 99% (estrogenicity). The key processes responsible for the plant's performances were the coagulation/flocculation/DAFF, main ozonation and activated carbon filtration. The effect of these 3 processes varied from one compound or bioassay to another but their combination was almost totally responsible for the overall observed reduction. Bioassays yielded complementary information, e.g. estrogenic compounds were not detected in the secondary effluent by chemical analysis, but the samples had an estrogenic effect. The main ozonation formed oxidation by-products of the organic micropollutants but decreased the level of non-specific toxicity and other specific toxic modes of action, demonstrating that the mixture of oxidation by-products was less potent than the mixture of the parent compounds for the considered effects.
In utero and lactational exposure to bisphenol A, in contrast to ethinyl estradiol, does not alter sexually dimorphic behavior, puberty, fertility, and anatomy of female LE rats.	Many chemicals released into the environment display estrogenic activity including the oral contraceptive ethinyl estradiol (EE2) and the plastic monomer bisphenol A (BPA). EE2 is present in some aquatic systems at concentrations sufficient to alter reproductive function of fishes. Many concerns have been raised about the potential effects of BPA. The National Toxicology Program rated the potential effects of low doses of BPA on behavior and central nervous system (CNS) as an area of "some concern," whereas most effects were rated as of "negligible" or "minimal" concern. However, the number of robust studies in this area was limited. The current study was designed to determine if maternal exposure to relatively low oral doses of EE2 or BPA in utero and during lactation would alter the expression of well-characterized sexually dimorphic behaviors or alter the age of puberty or reproductive function in the female Long-Evans rat offspring. Pregnant rats were gavaged with vehicle, EE2 (0.05-50 microg/kg/day), or BPA (2, 20, and 200 microg/kg/day) from day 7 of gestation to postnatal day (PND) 18, and the female offspring were studied. EE2 (50 microg/kg/day) increased anogenital distance and reduced pup body weight at PND2, accelerated the age at vaginal opening, reduced F1 fertility and F2 litter sizes, and induced malformations of the external genitalia (5 microg/kg). F1 females exposed to EE2 also displayed a reduced (male-like) saccharin preference (5 microg/kg) and absence of lordosis behavior (15 microg/kg), indications of defeminization of the CNS. BPA had no effect on any of the aforementioned measures. These results demonstrate that developmental exposure to pharmacologically relevant dosage levels of EE2 can permanently disrupt the reproductive morphology and function of the female rat.
Effects of sub-chronic exposure to terbutryn in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.).	The sub-chronic effects of terbutryn at concentrations 0.02 (reported concentration in Czech rivers), 4, 20, and 40 microg L(-1) were assessed in one-year-old common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) exposed for 28 days and compared to a non-treated control group. Its influence on biometric parameters, hematology, blood biochemistry, and histology was investigated. Exposure to terbutryn at 0.02 microg L(-1) showed no observable effect, whereas exposure to 4, 20, and 40 microg L(-1) showed significantly higher erythrocyte counts, ammonia levels, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and lactate, but significantly lower mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and creatine. Cell shape changes and lipid inclusions were found in hepatocytes, and there was destruction of caudal kidney tubules when compared to control fish.
Determining cadmium critical concentrations in natural soils by assessing Collembola mortality, reproduction and growth.	The toxicity of cadmium for the Collembola Folsomia candida was studied by determining the effects of increasing Cd concentrations on growth, survival and reproduction in three cultivated and forested soils with different pH (4.5-8.2) and organic matter content (1.6-16.5%). The Cd concentration in soil CaCl(2) exchangeable fraction, in soil solution and in Collembola body was determined. At similar total soil concentrations, the Cd concentration in soil solutions strongly decreased with increasing pH. Reproduction was the most sensitive parameter. Low organic matter content was a limiting factor for reproduction. Effect of Cd on reproduction was better described by soil or body concentrations than by soil solution concentration. Values of EC(50-Repro) expressed on the basis of nominal soil concentration were 182, 111 and 107 microg g(-1), respectively, for a carbonated cultivated soil (AU), an acid forested soil with high organic matter (EPC) and a circumneutral cultivated soil with low organic content (SV). Sensitivity to Cd was enhanced for low OM content and acidic pH. The effect of Cd on reproduction is not directly related to Cd concentration in soil solution for carbonated soil: a very low value is found for EC(50-Repro) (0.17) based on soil solution for the soil with the highest pH (AU; pH=8.2). Chronic toxicity cannot be predicted on the basis of soluble fractions. Critical concentrations were 8 x 10(-5), 1.1, 0.3 microg mL(-1), respectively, for AU, EPC and SV soils.
Toxicity of selected pesticides to freshwater shrimp, Paratya australiensis (Decapoda: Atyidae): use of time series acute toxicity data to predict chronic lethality.	Toxicity of six pesticides (carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, dimethoate, diuron and fenarimol) to the freshwater shrimp, Paratya australiensis was assessed after 96 h exposures. Of the six pesticides tested, alpha cypermethrin was the most toxic to the shrimp followed by chlorpyrifos, carbaryl, dimethoate, fenarimol and diuron. Regression methods for predicting chronic toxicity (lethality) from acute lethality data with shrimp were developed and compared, and it was found that the log-log model gives the most reliable predictions of the probability of death as a function of extended exposure times. Based on this model, chronic toxicity (21 days) to P. australiensis was estimated as 0.0058 microg/L for alpha cypermethrin, 4.9 microg/L for carbaryl, 0.004 microg/L for chlorpyrifos, 89 microg/L for dimethoate, 240 microg/L for diuron and 1500 microg/L for fenarimol. Acute LC(10) values were also useful predictors of the chronic lethality. The log-log model was used to derive extrapolated chronic values that were compared to measured experimental chronic values for two fish species. The predictions of chronic toxicity based on acute toxicity data were found to give credible results for both fish species. These predictions of chronic toxicity can therefore be used in ecological risk assessments to fill in gaps with reasonable confidence where no measured estimates of chronic toxicity are available.
Toxicity of char residues produced in the co-pyrolysis of different wastes.	Char residues produced in the co-pyrolysis of different wastes (plastics, pine biomass and used tyres) were characterized using chemical and toxicity assays. One part of the solid chars was submitted to extraction with dichloromethane (DCM) in order to reduce the toxicity of the char residues by removing organic contaminants. The different volatility fractions present in the extracted char (Char A) and in the raw char (Char B) were determined by progressive weight loss combustion. A selected group of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Hg and As) was determined in both chars. The chars were subjected to the leaching test ISO/TS 21268 - 2, 2007 and the resulting eluates were further characterized by determining a group of inorganic parameters (pH, conductivity, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Hg and As contents) and the concentrations of several organic contaminants (volatile aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl phenols). An ecotoxicological characterization was also performed by using the bio-indicator Vibrio fischeri. The chemical and ecotoxicological results were analyzed according to the Council Decision 2003/33/CE and the criteria on the evaluation methods of waste ecotoxicity (CEMWE). The results obtained in this work indicated that the extraction with DCM is an effective method for the removal of organic contaminants of high to medium volatility from pyrolysis solid residues, thus decreasing their toxicity potential. Zn can be leached from the chars even after the DCM extraction treatment and can contribute to the ecotoxicity of the eluates obtained from chars. Both chars (treated and non treated with DCM) were classified as hazardous and ecotoxic wastes.
Time-course, dose-response, and age comparative sensitivity of N-methyl carbamates in rats.	N-Methyl carbamate insecticides are reversible inhibitors of central and peripheral acetylcholinesterase (ChE). Despite their widespread use, there are few studies of neurotoxicity in young animals. To study potential age-related differences, we evaluated seven carbamates (carbaryl, carbofuran, formetanate, methiocarb, methomyl, oxamyl, and propoxur) in preweanling (17 days old or postnatal day [PND] 17) male rats. Motor activity was monitored, and ChE inhibition was measured in brain and red blood cells (RBCs) using a radiometric assay that minimized reactivation of ChE. First, we conducted time-course studies in PND17 Long-Evans male rats, using a single oral dose of each carbamate. Almost all carbamates showed maximal ChE inhibition at a 45-min time point; only methomyl showed an earlier peak effect (15 min). At 24 h, most inhibition had recovered. Next, dose-response data were collected for each carbamate, using four doses and control, with motor activity testing beginning 15 min after dosing and tissue collection at 40-45 min. RBC ChE was generally inhibited to a greater degree than brain. Motor activity was not as sensitive a measure for some of the carbamates, with some differences across carbamates in the shapes of the dose-response curves. Additional studies documented age-related differences by comparing ChE inhibition in PND11, PND17, and adult rats following administration of carbaryl or carbofuran. Only the youngest (PND11) rats were more sensitive than adults to carbaryl, but both younger ages showed more effects than adults with carbofuran. Comparisons of the other carbamates to previous studies in adult rats suggest similar age-related sensitivity. Thus, these data show the time-course and dose-response characteristics for each carbamate and document greater sensitivity of the young for carbofuran and carbaryl.
Role of food and clay particles in toxicity of copper and diazinon using Daphnia magna.	Toxicity changes in copper and diazinon were investigated in the presence of food, clay, and their mixture by using Daphnia magna. In sorption equilibrium experiments, copper was significantly attracted (>34% sorbed) to food, clay, and food-clay mixture due to their negative zeta potential, while diazinon was less sorbed (<11%). In the exposure test with food and clay particles, it was revealed that copper was remarkably reduced in the presence of clay particles indicating the change in bioavailability of copper by sorption to clay. This was considered as the primary mechanism for toxicity reduction whereas diazinon toxicity was food dependent in the analysis of toxicity using toxicity change index (TCI). It was also shown that certain foods could not only act as a sorbent to copper and diazinon, but also as a material of energy source to alleviate the toxic damage. Meanwhile, clay can be considered as a prominent sorbent to copper but not to diazinon and can inhibit the sorption interaction between foodstuffs and toxicants through the aggregation and sedimentation processes. Furthermore, clay particles, as shown in TCI analysis, may be a potentially risky material as a physiological stressor or a toxicant carrier in contaminated environments.
Toxic effects of T-2 toxin on reproductive system in male mice.	The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of T-2 toxin on semen quality, fertility and serum testosterone concentration in mice. Adult male mice were mated with sexually mature untreated female mice after being exposed to intraperitoneal injection of T-2 toxin at 0, 5, 10 or 15 mg/kg body weight daily for 7 successive days. Semen quality, serum testosterone concentration and fertility of treated mice were assessed. The results showed that the number of abnormal spermatozoa increased significantly and a significant decrease in spermatozoa with integrated acrosome was observed in males treated with T-2 toxin at all doses, As well, the amount of live spermatozoa decreased significantly in mice treated with 10 and 15 mg/kg body weight T-2 toxin. Low pregnancy rate and high fetal resorption rate were observed when females were mated with T-2 toxin-exposed males. Testicular and cauda epididymal sperm counts, efficiency of sperm production and serum testosterone concentration were significantly reduced in mice treated with T-2 toxin at all doses in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, these findings indicated that T-2 toxin presented toxic effects on reproductive system of adult male mice.
Role of Eisenia fetida in rapid recycling of nutrients from bio sludge of beverage industry.	Beverage industry bio sludge proved to be toxic when given alone to earthworms even after stabilization for 15 days, therefore, it was mixed in various proportions with cattle dung. Best suitable mixture for highest survival, maximum growth and highest population buildup of Eisenia fetida was determined by observing mortality, growth rate, rate of cocoon production, population buildup and time taken for decomposition of waste. Minimum mortality and maximum population buildup were observed in 50:50 mixture of bio sludge and cattle dung. Nitrogen, phosphorous, sodium and pH increased in all the feed mixtures, while electrical conductivity, organic carbon and potassium declined in all the samples in comparison to traditional compost (without worms). Degradation of 50:50 mixture could be achieved in 75 days when worms were inoculated at 25 g/kg feed mixture. But the best-quality product was obtained after 105-110 days with 7.5 g worms/kg feed mixture.
Comparative cytotoxicity and intracellular accumulation of five polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners in mouse cerebellar granule neurons.	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of flame retardants comprising 209 congeners, have become widespread environmental pollutants. High levels of PBDEs have been detected in human tissues, particularly in North America, and body burden is especially high in infants and toddlers because of exposure through breast milk and house dust. Increasing evidence, provided by animal studies, suggests that PBDEs are developmental neurotoxicants, although the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Various PBDEs have been reported to cause oxidative stress and to induce apoptotic cell death in several cell types. In the present study, we investigated the comparative neurotoxicity in mouse cerebellar granule neurons of five brominated diphenyl ether (BDE) congeners, chosen among the most commonly found at the highest levels in human tissues. All BDE congener tested (BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, and BDE-209) decreased cell viability and induced apoptotic cell death, which was prevented by antioxidants. They also caused oxidative stress, as indicated by an increase in reactive oxygen species and in lipid peroxidation. For all end points measured, the potency ranking of the congeners was BDE-100 > BDE-47 > BDE-99 > BDE-153 >> BDE-209. Measurement of BDE congener levels in neurons after exposure to different concentrations showed a significant accumulation in cells, which followed the same relative ranking. The findings suggest that all BDE congeners tested exhibit the same general mode of action (induction of oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis) and that the ability of each isomer to elicit such effects is dependent upon their accumulation in neurons, particularly in the microsomal fraction and the mitochondria.
Assessing the effects of exposure timing on biomarker expression using 17beta-estradiol.	Temporal and spatial variability in estrogenicity has been documented for many treated wastewater effluents with the consequences of this variability on the expression of biomarkers of endocrine disruption being largely unknown. Laboratory exposure studies usually utilize constant exposure concentrations which may produce biological effects that differ from those observed in organisms exposed in natural environments. In this study, we investigated the effects of differential timing of exposures with 17beta-estradiol (E2) on a range of fathead minnow biomarkers to simulate diverse environmentally relevant exposure profiles. Two 21-day, replicate experiments were performed exposing mature male fathead minnows to E2 at time-weighted mean concentrations (similar average exposure to the contaminant during the 21-day exposure period; 17ng E2/L experiment 1; 12ng E2/L experiment 2) comparable to E2 equivalency values (EEQ) reported for several anthropogenically altered environments. A comparable time-weighted mean concentration of E2 was applied to five treatments which varied in the daily application schema: E2 was either applied at a steady rate (ST), in a gradual decreasing concentration (HI), a gradual increasing concentration (LO), applied intermittently (IN), or at a randomly varying concentration (VA). We assessed a range of widely used physiological (vitellogenin mRNA induction and plasma concentrations), anatomical (body and organ indices, secondary sex characteristics, and histopathology), and behavioral (nest holding) biomarkers reported to change following exposure to endocrine active compounds (EACs). All treatments responded with a rise in plasma vitellogenin concentration when compared with the ethanol carrier control. Predicatively, vitellogenin mRNA induction, which tracked closely with plasma vitellogenin concentrations in most treatments was not elevated in the HI treatment, presumably due to the lack of E2 exposure immediately prior to analysis. The ability of treatment male fish to hold nest sites in direct competition with control males was sensitive to E2 exposure and did yield statistically significant differences between treatments and carrier control. Other biological endpoints assessed in this study (organosomatic indices, secondary sex characteristics) varied little between treatments and controls. This study indicates that a broad suite of endpoints is necessary to fully assess the biological consequences of fish exposure to estrogens and that for at least field studies, a combination of vitellogenin mRNA and plasma vitellogenin analysis are most promising in deciphering exposure histories of wild-caught and caged fishes.
Ascorbyl dipalmitate/PEG-lipid nanoparticles as a novel carrier for hydrophobic drugs.	L-ascorbyl 2,6-dipalmitate (ASC-DP), a fatty ester derivative of ascorbic acid, is poorly soluble in water and does not spontaneously form micelles or liposomal structures in water. In this study, we attempted to prepare an ASC-DP/surfactant nano-sized complex as a carrier for hydrophobic drugs. Samples were prepared by hydrating a solvent-evaporated film of ASC-DP/surfactant at a molar ratio of 1:1. Among the surfactants tested, distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine-polyethylene glycol 2000 (DSPE-PEG) was found to form stable nanoparticles with ASC-DP (average particle size: ca. 67 nm). Several hydrophobic drugs were incorporated in the ASC-DP/DSPE-PEG nanoparticles. Stability, toxicity, and blood residence of the drug-containing ASC-DP/DSPE-PEG nanoparticles were evaluated using amphotericin B (AmB) as the model drug. By intravenously administering mice with the formulations, we determined the minimum lethal dose of Fungizone, a formulation of AmB solubilized with sodium deoxycholate, was 3.0 mg/kg, while that of AmB/ASC-DP/DSPE-PEG nanoparticles was 10.0 mg/kg. When 2.0 mg/kg, Fungizone was administered, the mice showed higher renal and hepatic toxicities. Intravenously administered AmB/ASC-DP/DSPE-PEG nanoparticles demonstrated higher concentration in plasma than Fungizone. Thus, the ASC-DP/DSPE-PEG nanoparticle system appears to be a promising delivery system for hydrophobic drugs.
The effects of 17beta-estradiol on various reproductive parameters in the hermaphrodite fish Kryptolebias marmoratus.	The effect of a single injection of 17beta-estradiol (E2) was evaluated in the hermaphrodite fish Kryptolebias marmoratus. The fish [average body weight (BW), 0.15+/-0.01 g] were injected with either two concentrations of E2 (1 and 100 microg/g BW) once intraperitoneally. They were sampled at intervals of 7, 15, and 30 days after a single E2 injection. Gonadosomatic index (GSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI), the frequency of gonadal development, number of ovulated eggs, and plasma steroids levels were measured. The transcript abundances of vitellogenin (VTG) and estrogen receptors (ERalpha and beta) mRNA in the liver were also analyzed using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (real time PCR). GSI and the frequency of mature oocytes in the 100-microg E2-exposed group decreased compared to that of the control group during the experiment, and the number of ovulated eggs in the 100-microg E2-exposed group was lower when compared to the other groups. However, plasma E2 and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) levels were not significantly different between the experimental groups. On the other hand, plasma testosterone level and VTG mRNA abundance in the 100-microg E2-exposed group were significantly lower than the control group after 30 days. These results indicate that E2 stimulation at high concentration interferes with reproductive phenomena through delayed response. In addition, HSI in the 100-microg E2-exposed group and ERalpha mRNA abundance in the 1-microg E2-exposed group were significantly higher than the control group at 7 days after E2 injection, although there was no significant difference in HSI and ERalpha mRNA between all groups at 30 days. These results indicate temporal responses in reproductive parameters following high-dose E2 exposure in the hermaphrodite fish K. marmoratus.
Quantitative investigation on the metabolism of 1,3-butadiene and of its oxidized metabolites in once-through perfused livers of mice and rats.	The industrial chemical 1,3-butadiene (BD) is a potent carcinogen in mice and a weak one in rats. This difference is generally related to species-specific burdens by the metabolites 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB), 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB), and 3,4-epoxy-1,2-butanediol (EBD), which are all formed in the liver. Only limited data exist on BD metabolism in the rodent liver. Therefore, metabolism of BD, its epoxides, and the intermediate 3-butene-1,2-diol (B-diol) was studied in once-through perfused livers of male B6C3F1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. In BD perfusions, predominantly EB and B-diol were found (both species). DEB and EBD were additionally detected in mouse livers. Metabolism of BD showed saturation kinetics (both species). In EB perfusions, B-diol, EBD, and DEB were formed with B-diol being the major metabolite. Net formation of DEB was larger in mouse than in rat livers. In both species, hepatic clearance (Cl(H)) of EB was slightly smaller than the perfusion flow. In DEB perfusions, EBD was formed as a major metabolite. Cl(H) of DEB was 61% (mouse) and 73% (rat) of the perfusion flow. In the B-diol-perfused rat liver, EBD was formed as a minor metabolite. Cl(H) of B-diol was 53% (mouse) and 34% (rat) of the perfusion flow. In EBD-perfused rat livers, Cl(H) of EBD represented only 22% of the perfusion flow. There is evidence for qualitative species differences with regard to the enzymes involved in BD metabolism. The first quantitative findings in whole livers showing intrahepatic first-pass metabolism of BD and EB metabolites will improve the risk estimation of BD.
Effect of ozone/oxygen mixture on systemic oxidative stress and organic damage.	Ozone is a molecule of high energetic content. Its great oxidative power has been used in medicine for the treatment of several illnesses with a wide spectrum. The rectal insufflation with a mixture of ozone/oxygen is considered as a simple therapy, not painful, of low cost and practically free from adverse effects. Given its potential oxidation and lack of side-effects, the objective has been to know the state of different indexes of redox state in blood which may contribute to understanding the mechanism by which mixtures of ozone/oxygen administered by intrarectal route are able to exert actions on other organs. With this purpose female rabbits were used, distributed into four groups, and three doses of ozone/oxygen mixture were tested. When treatment was finished, the determination of pro-oxidant and antioxidant markers was carried out. Also indexes of organic damage were determined. Ozone doses administered to rabbits did not cause adverse effects and mortality did not show significant changes relative to tissue damages and they increased enzymes activities belonging to the first line antioxidant defences. The results demonstrate that ozone/oxygen mixture administered by rectal insufflations is innocuous and it is able to increase the antioxidant defense of the organism.
Assessing the toxicity on [C3mim][Tf2N] to aquatic organisms of different trophic levels.	Ionic liquids (ILs) are an exciting class of neoteric solvents that are being object of great attention as a potential replacement to conventional environmental damaging solvents in industrial applications. Despite some progress concerning ILs' toxicity and their environmental impact, the information about these compounds is still scarce. In this work, biological tests were performed to establish the toxicity of 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [C3mim][Tf2N], in five aquatic species at different trophic levels. Freshwater algal growth inhibition (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Chlorella vulgaris), freshwater cladocerans' immobilization and chronic traits (Daphnia magna and Daphnia longispina) and viability of luminescent marine bacteria (Vibrio fischeri) were investigated. The sensitivity of the different species to the IL was compared in order to determine further repercussions in trophic food web. It is shown that the studied IL is moderately toxic to the studied organisms. P. subcapitata and D. magna are the most tolerant species and C. vulgaris and D. longispina the most sensitive to its presence.
Inclusion of poorly soluble drugs in highly ordered mesoporous silica nanoparticles.	Silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with a highly ordered mesoporous structures (103A) with cubic Im3 m have been synthesized using triblock copolymers with high poly(alkylene oxide) (EO) segments in acid media. The produced nanoparticles displayed large specific surface area (approximately 765 cm(2)/g) with an average particles size of 120 nm. The loading efficiency was assessed by incorporating three major antiepileptic active substances via passive loading and it was found to varying from 17 to 25%. The state of the adsorbed active agents was further analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). Dissolution studies revealed rapid release profiles within the first 3 h. The viability of 3T3 endothelial cells was not affected in the presence of MSNs indicating negligible cytotoxicity.
The use of marine benthic diatoms in a growth inhibition test with spiked whole-sediment.	The benthic diatom Cylindrotheca closterium was exposed to whole-sediment spiked with the synthetic surfactant Linear Alkylbenzene Sulphonate (LAS), as commercial mixture or individual homologues (C10-LAS, C11-LAS or C12-LAS). Separately, the diatoms were exposed to C12-LAS in a water-only system. The algal growth was determined after 72 h. The 72-h ErC50 values ranged from <or=4 to 29 mg/kg sediment, suggesting that C. closterium was sensitive to LAS. The outcomes were reproducible with a variation factor lower than 3, showing the reproducibility of the method. The test set up was cost effective, used little bench space and employed a micro-phytobenthos species that fulfilled most of the criteria for a suitable test species in sediment systems. The 72-h ErC50 obtained in a water-only system (0.141 mg/L) was ca. 2 orders of magnitude lower (0.002 mg/L). This was likely due to an indirect effect of the use of fresh sediment.
Biochemical, metabolic, and behavioural responses and recovery of Daphnia magna after exposure to an organophosphate.	The responses of various suborganismal and organismal endpoints of Daphnia magna to pulse exposure to sublethal levels of the organophosphate paraoxon-methyl were compared. The changes and recovery of biochemical, metabolic, and behavioural variables, as well as physiological responses, were observed. The cholinesterase (ChE), filtration, and swimming activities were all affected in a concentration-dependent manner, and these effects reached significance at concentrations of 1.0, 1.5, and 0.7 microg L(-1), respectively. The levels of these variables recovered significantly after detoxification for 24h in clean medium. ChE and swimming activities were affected significantly by lower concentrations of paraoxon-methyl than filtration activity, which had the same threshold as the physiological responses ((15)N abundance and body size). This study showed that among the parameters studied, swimming activity was the most sensitive, whereas changes in filtration activity had the most significant physiological consequences, and were therefore important in terms of effects propagation to the population level.
Biomarker candidate discovery in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) continuously exposed to North Sea produced water from egg to fry.	In this study Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were exposed to different levels of North Sea produced water (PW) and 17beta-oestradiol (E(2)), a natural oestrogen, from egg to fry stage (90 days). By comparing changes in protein expression following E(2) exposure to changes induced by PW treatment, we were able to compare the induced changes by PW to the mode of action of oestrogens. Changes in the proteome in response to exposure in whole cod fry (approximately 80 days post-hatching, dph) were detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and image analysis and identified by MALDI-ToF-ToF mass spectrometry, using a newly developed cod EST database and the NCBI database. Many of the protein changes occurred at low levels (0.01% and 0.1% PW) of exposure, indicating putative biological responses at lower levels than previously detected. Using discriminant analysis, we identified a set of protein changes that may be useful as biomarker candidates of produced water (PW) and oestradiol exposure in Atlantic cod fry. The biomarker candidates discovered in this study may, following validation, prove effective as diagnostic tools in monitoring exposure and effects of discharges from the petroleum industry offshore, aiding future environmental risk analysis and risk management.
Beryllium contamination and exposure monitoring in an inhalation laboratory setting.	Beryllium (Be) is used in several forms: pure metal, beryllium oxide, and as an alloy with copper, aluminum, or nickel. Beryllium oxide, beryllium metal, and beryllium alloys are the main forms present in the workplace, with inhalation being the primary route of exposure. Cases of workers with sensitization or chronic beryllium disease challenge the scientific community for a better understanding of Be toxicity. Therefore, a toxicological inhalation study using a murine model was performed in our laboratory in order to identify the toxic effects related to different particle sizes and chemical forms of Be. This article attempts to provide information regarding the relative effectiveness of the environmental monitoring and exposure protection program that was enacted to protect staff (students and researchers) in this controlled animal beryllium inhalation exposure experiment. This includes specific attention to particle migration control through intensive housekeeping and systematic airborne and surface monitoring. Results show that the protective measures applied during this research have been effective. The highest airborne Be concentration in the laboratory was less than one-tenth of the Quebec OEL (occupational exposure limit) of 0.15 microg/m(3). Considering the protection factor of 10(3) of the powered air-purifying respirator used in this research, the average exposure level would be 0.03 x 10(- 4) microg/m(3), which is extremely low. Moreover, with the exception of one value, all average Be concentrations on surfaces were below the Quebec Standard guideline level of 3 microg/100 cm(2) for Be contamination. Finally, all beryllium lymphocyte proliferation tests for the staff were not higher than controls.
Fuel toxicity on Isochrysis galbana and a coastal phytoplankton assemblage: growth rate vs. variable fluorescence.	Laboratory cultures of the flagellate Isochrysis galbana and a coastal phytoplankton assemblage were used to assess the feasibility of variable fluorescence (F(v)), measured by means of fast repetition rate fluorometry, as endpoint to monitor the effect of fuel on microalgae as compared to phytoplankton growth rate. Parallel changes in cell size of I. galbana and taxonomic composition of the natural assemblage were recorded. The results presented in this investigation indicate that F(v) is a suitable endpoint to this aim, due to the ease and rapidity of the measurement, ecological relevance and sensitivity. The derived effective concentrations provided toxicity thresholds similar to, or even lower than concentrations derived from embryo-larval bioassays with marine organisms. The lowest calculated EC(10) corresponded to that of the natural assemblage, 2.5 microg eq chrysene L(-1), concentration easily exceeded in high maritime traffic areas subjected to frequent spillages.
Growth and transcriptional effect of dietary 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE-47) exposure in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio).	In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were fed food dosed with pure PBDE-47 (2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether) congener or a blank from 20 to 60 day post-hatch (dph). At 38 dph, half of the fish were sampled for body size measurements and gene expression analyzes (CYP1A1, VTG, TTR, D1, and TSH-beta). At 60 dph, body size was measured again for all fish remaining. Whole-fish histology was performed and the PBDE levels in fish were determined. PBDE treated fish was significantly smaller at 38 dph but not at 60 dph. No apparent histopathological effect was observed. In the PBDE treated fish, there was a weak induction of CYP1A1 mRNA transcription, but not of the other genes. The tissue levels of PBDE-47 were comparable to that found in other wild fish reported in the literature, indicating that our exposure level was ecologically relevant.
The physicochemistry and toxicology of CFA particles.	The term "technogenic particles" is used to describe airborne particulate matter (PM) produced during industrial processes. The most common of these is "fly ash" produced during combustion of solid and liquid fossil fuels. Coal fly ash is derived from the mineral and metal contaminants within coal in which particles (1) are distinctly spherical in shape, (2) are composed of 60-90% glass, and (3) often contain a range of contaminant metals. In addition, particles may contain recrystallized minerals, mainly quartz, mullite, and hematite; both quartz and mullite are recognized respiratory hazards. Fly ash particles from both UK and Chinese coal-burning power stations were characterized by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (morphology and size), x-ray diffraction (crystallinity and minerals), and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (elemental composition). PM(10) samples were separated from bulk fly ash by a dry dust separator system. The plasmid scission assay (PSA) was used to measure damage produced by fly ash to plasmid bacteriophage PhiX174 RF DNA. The supercoiled DNA was either damaged or severely damaged by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the fly ash at different concentrations. Geochemical analyses confirmed that the fly ash particles are predominantly glass, with a minor component of the minerals quartz, hematite, and mullite. Fly ash particles also contained a range of metals contaminants; however, these were mostly bound into the glass with only a small proportion potentially bioaccessible. PSA data showed that fly ash exhibited significant oxidative capacity when compared to negative control (MB H(2)O), indicating that ROS are likely to be the driving force underlying fly ash bioreactivity.
Direct fibrogenic effects of dispersed single-walled carbon nanotubes on human lung fibroblasts.	Nanomaterials, including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), are being developed for a variety of commercial products. However, adverse health effects attributed to these new materials are not well understood. Recent reports showed that exposure of mice to dispersed SWCNT (DSWCNT) produced a rapid and progressive interstitial lung fibrosis without persistent inflammation. To understand the mechanism underlying this unusual fibrogenicity of DSWCNT, the present investigation focused on the direct bioactivity of DSWCNT using a cell culture of lung fibroblasts that represent a major cell type resident in the lung interstitium and responsible for the production of collagen matrix. At concentrations relevant to those used in vivo, in vitro exposure of lung fibroblasts to DSWCNT stimulated cell proliferation and induced collagen production without producing cell damage. One of the major matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), MMP-9, which is known to be involved in lung fibrosis, was also elevated by DSWCNT treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that direct stimulation of fibroblasts by DSWCNT translocated into the interstitium may play a significant role in DSWCNT-induced lung fibrosis. Our data also suggest that the dispersion status and/or size of the SWCNT structures is a critical factor in determining nanoparticle fibrogenicity and that MMP-9 may be involved in the fibrogenic process. The results obtained may aid in the development of in vitro models for rapid screening of the potential fibrogenicity of carbon nanotubes, which are lacking and urgently needed.
Histopathological and gene expression analysis of mice exposed to diethylstilbestrol.	The estrogenic compound diethylstilbestrol (DES) has been widely studied to understand its potential involvement in endocrine function and carcinogenesis. This study examined the influence of DES on adult mice by histopathological analysis and studied the gene expression changes using mRNA differential display. Pathological changes in the mice following DES exposure included testicular atrophy, ovarian and hepatic fibrosis, and reduced numbers of mature oocytes and spermatogenic cells. Other pathological changes, such as cirrhosis of the liver, were also found. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying these effects, we used mRNA differential display to analyze changes in gene expression following DES exposure. In total, 20 genes were differentially expressed in liver, kidney, ovary, uterus, and testis. All putative target genes were validated by QRT-PCR. The study provides evidence that DES has an acute effect on gene expression. The results may facilitate the discovery of the genotoxic mechanism of DES and allow one to discover new DES-responsive genes.
Hazard identification of strong dermal sensitizers.	Dermal reactions are the most frequently reported chemical health-related occupational hazard. Identifying dermal sensitizers is important for improving workplace safety. This paper takes a close look at the physico-chemical properties and results from the Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) to better understand and predict potent dermal sensitizers. The LLNA was used to identify 28 pharmaceutical agents or chemical intermediates as potent dermal sensitizers, EC3 < 1%. Certain parameters were examined to determine if there was any predictability to identify potent dermal sensitizers. These included a computer structure activity analysis using Derek for Windows, molecular weight (Mw), calculated log P, and the log-linear extrapolation approach for estimating the potency. With Derek for Windows, 13 compounds were identified as negative and 15 as positive for structural alerts, the most common being haloalkanes, and hydrazines. Additional mechanisms of reactivity were postulated for the remaining compounds. The examination of the Mw showed that all molecules had Mw < 550 Da. For 21 compounds, the interpolated vs extrapolated methods for determining the EC3 value were compared. For eight of the 21 compounds, the extrapolated EC3 was in the correct order of magnitude, eight were incorrect (five were too high and three were too low) and five could not be calculated. The use of a tiered approach including examination of the structural and physico-chemical properties and the LLNA to identify potent dermal sensitizers is integral in the selection of effective safe handling guidance to protect from sensitization hazards.
Safety assessment of EPA-rich triglyceride oil produced from yeast: genotoxicity and 28-day oral toxicity in rats.	The 28-day repeat-dose oral and genetic toxicity of eicosapentaenoic acid triglyceride oil (EPA oil) produced from genetically modified Yarrowia lipolytica yeast were assessed. Groups of rats received 0 (olive oil), 940, 1880, or 2820 mg EPA oil/kg/day, or fish oil (sardine/anchovy source) by oral gavage. Lower total serum cholesterol was seen in all EPA and fish oil groups. Liver weights were increased in the medium and high-dose EPA (male only), and fish oil groups but were considered non-adverse physiologically adaptive responses. Increased thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy was observed in male high-dose EPA and fish oil groups, and was considered to be an adaptive response to high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. No adverse test substance-related effects were observed on body weight, nutritional, or other clinical or anatomic pathology parameters. The oil was not mutagenic in the in vitro Ames or mouse lymphoma assay, and was not clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. In conclusion, exposure for 28 days to EPA oil derived from yeast did not produce adverse effects at doses up to 2820 mg/kg/day and was not genotoxic. The safety profile of the EPA oil in these tests was comparable to a commercial fish oil.
Toxicological evaluation of ammonium 4,8-dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoate, a new emulsifier to replace ammonium perfluorooctanoate in fluoropolymer manufacturing.	Ammonium 4,8-dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoate (ADONA) was developed to replace ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO) as an emulsifier in the manufacture of fluoropolymers. The toxicity of ADONA was evaluated in acute and repeat-dose studies of up to 90-days duration, and in eye and skin irritation, dermal sensitization, genotoxicity, and developmental toxicity studies. ADONA was also evaluated as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonist in rats. ADONA was moderately toxic orally and practically non-toxic dermally in acute studies in rats. It was a mild skin irritant and a moderate to severe eye irritant in rabbits. It was a weak dermal sensitizer in local lymph node assays in mice. ADONA was not genotoxic based on the weight of evidence from five assays. It was not developmentally toxic in rats except at maternally toxic doses. ADONA was a possible PPARα agonist in male rats. The liver was the primary target organ in male rats and the kidney was the primary target organ in female rats. NOAELs in 28- and 90-day oral studies in rats were 10mg/kg/day for males and 100mg/kg/day for females. These findings demonstrate that the toxicity profile for ADONA is acceptable for its intended use and is superior to that of APFO.
Vinclozolin: a feasibility and sensitivity study of the ILSI-HESI F1-extended one-generation rat reproduction protocol.	Feasibility of the ILSI-HESI (ACSA) extended one-generation protocol was tested with vinclozolin (dietary 0, 4, 20, 100mg/kg/day). Parental Wistar rats (n=25/sex/dose) were dosed pre-mating (males 4, females 2 weeks) through F1 offspring weaning (postnatal day PND21); F1 dosing continued through PND70. At PND21, 3 subsets (each 1 pup/sex/litter) were selected for neurotoxicology (functional observational battery, motor activity, neuropathology), clinical pathology (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, thyroid hormone assay) (subsets 1a, 1b; each n=10/sex/dose), immunotoxicology (IgM) SRBC antibody response and natural killer cell assays (subset 2; n=25/sex/dose), and estrus cycle (subset 3; n=25/dose). Vinclozolin reduced parental and offspring bodyweight and prostate, seminal vesicles and epididymides weight, and increased adrenal weight/induced adrenal cortical hypertrophy at 100mg/kg. Mating, fertility, gestation and lactation were unaffected. At 20 and 100mg/kg, F1 males had reduced anogenital distance and retained areolae; at 100mg/kg only, there was hypospadias, purulent prostatitis and seminal vesicle inflammation with atrophy, and Leydig cell hyperplasia, and in F1 females accelerated vaginal opening. These effects are consistent with vinclozolin's known anti-androgenic developmental effects. Neuro- and immunotoxicology tests were unaffected. F1 Only T4 was reduced at 20 and 100mg/kg. The overall sensitivity of the extended one-generation protocol is comparable to or even greater than the current two-generation study. Thus it reduces animal use while maintaining or enhancing information for risk assessment.
The threshold of toxicological concern for prenatal developmental toxicity.	The Threshold Toxicological Concern (TTC) is based on the concept that reasonable assurance of safety can be given if exposure is sufficiently low. Originally based on the evaluation of carcinogenicity studies more recently TTC evaluations for other toxicological end points have been published. Here we report on the evaluation of our data base for oral developmental toxicity studies (OECD 414) in rats with 92 and 93 NOAEL values for maternal and developmental toxicity, respectively. The 5th percentile of the NOAEL distributions were calculated to be 4 mg/kg bw/d for maternal and 5mg/kg bw/d for developmental toxicity. Adding the data for developmental toxicity provided by Kroes et al. (2004), a joint evaluation of 111 individual NOAEL values resulted in a 5th percentile value of 4 mg/kg bw/d. Using a safety factor of 500 (to account for a possible underrepresentation of chemical classes) on the 5th percentile a TTC value for developmental toxicity of 8 μg/kg bw/d based on the combined data and for maternal toxicity of 8 μg/kg bw/d based on our data base was calculated. Within the REACH context this value may serve as guidance whether to perform an animal experiment or to rely on a TTC value if estimated exposure is sufficiently low.
In vitro and in vivo efficacy of Acorus calamus extract against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus.	To develop a environment friendly control measure against cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, medicinally important plants were identified and extracts were prepared. Twelve 95% ethanolic, thirteen 50% hydroethanolic and nine hot water extracts were prepared and tested against laboratory reared homogenous colony of R. (B.) microplus. Amongst the 34 extracts, 26 extracts showed no mortality within 72 h of application while 12.0 ± 4.9% to 35.0 ± 9.6% mortality of treated ticks was recorded in other extracts. Of the effective extracts, the extract prepared from rhizome of Acorus calamus proved highly efficacious and 100% final mortality within 14 DPT was recorded. The LC85 value of the extract was determined as 11.26. In vivo experiments confirmed the efficacy of the extract up to 42%, and repeat application was required after 7 DPT. The extract was found safe and no reaction was observed when animals were treated with 50% of the concentration, which was five times of the concentration used for in vivo studies. The possibility of using the extract for the control of cattle tick is discussed.
Computational analysis for hepatic safety signals of constituents present in botanical extracts widely used by women in the United States for treatment of menopausal symptoms.	Black cohosh, red clover, hops, and chasteberry are botanicals commonly used to alleviate menopausal symptoms in the US, and are examined in this study as part of a FDA Office of Women's Health research collaboration to expand knowledge on the safety of these botanical products. Computational approaches using classic (quantitative) structure-activity relationships ((Q)SAR), probabilistic reasoning, machine learning methods, and human expert rule-based systems were employed to deliver human hepatobiliary adverse effect predictions. The objective is to profile and analyze constituents that are alerting for the human hepatobiliary adverse effects. Computational analysis of positively predicted constituents showed that common structural features contributing to the hepatobiliary adverse effect predictions contain phenolic, flavone, isoflavone, glucoside conjugated flavone and isoflavone, and 4-hydroxyacetophenone structures. Specifically, protocatechuic acid from black cohosh, benzofuran and 4-vinylphenol from chasteberry, and xanthohumol I from hops were botanical constituents predicted positive for liver toxicity endpoints and were also confirmed with literature findings. However, comparison between the estimated human exposure to these botanical constituents and the LOAEL and NOAEL in published animal liver toxicology studies for these constituents demonstrated varying margins of safety. This study will serve as regulatory decision support information for regulators at the FDA to help with the process of prioritizing chemicals for testing.
Neurotoxic and immunotoxic effects of fenthion and omethoate on frogs at acute exposure.	The study was carried out to investigate the neurotoxic and immunotoxic effects of fenthion- and omethoate-used agricultural areas on frogs (Rana ridibunda) at acute exposure. The neurotoxic effects of the chemicals were evaluated by measuring the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Biomarkers selected for immunotoxic monitoring were the activities of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in various tissues of frogs exposed to 10 or 20 parts per million (ppm) dosages of fenthion and omethoate for 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. Results showed that the administrations of chemicals fluctuated AChE and BChE activities in some tissues of frogs treated with both dosages at all the periods. With regard to the immunotoxic effects, MPO activity was increased in almost all the tissues of frogs after 10 and 20 ppm dosages and for 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours exposure of fenthion and omethoate as compared to those of control whereas ADA activity did not change in all the tissues. This may reflect the potential role of these parameters as useful biomarkers for toxicity of fenthion and omethoate.
In vitro screening for population variability in chemical toxicity.	Immortalized human lymphoblastoid cell lines have been used to demonstrate that it is possible to use an in vitro model system to identify genetic factors that affect responses to xenobiotics. To extend the application of such studies to investigative toxicology by assessing interindividual and population-wide variability and heritability of chemical-induced toxicity phenotypes, we have used cell lines from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) trios assembled by the HapMap Consortium. Our goal is to aid in the development of predictive in vitro genetics-anchored models of chemical-induced toxicity. Cell lines from the CEPH trios were exposed to three concentrations of 14 environmental chemicals. We assessed ATP production and caspase-3/7 activity 24 h after treatment. Replicate analyses were used to evaluate experimental variability and classify responses. We show that variability of response across the cell lines exists for some, but not all, chemicals, with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and phenobarbital eliciting the greatest degree of interindividual variability. Although the data for the chemicals used here do not show evidence for broad-sense heritability of toxicity response phenotypes, substantial cell line variation was found, and candidate genetic factors contributing to the variability in response to PFOA were investigated using genome-wide association analysis. The approach of screening chemicals for toxicity in a genetically defined yet diverse in vitro human cell-based system is potentially useful for identification of chemicals that may pose a highest risk, the extent of within-species variability in the population, and genetic loci of interest that potentially contribute to chemical susceptibility.
Application of high throughput perfusion micro 3-D cell culture platform for the precise study of cellular responses to extracellular conditions -effect of serum concentrations on the physiology of articular chondrocytes.	Mammalian cells are sensitive to extracellular microenvironments. In order to faithfully explore the physiological responses of cells to extracellular conditions, a steady, homogenous, and three-dimensional (3-D) culture environment is required because it can provide a more quantifiable and biologically-relevant culture condition. To achieve this, this study reports a perfusion micro cell culture platform encompassing 22 microbioreactor units for high throughput 3-D cell culture. The cell culture platform structurally consisting of a plug and a microbioreactor chamber module was simply fabricated by replica molding of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer. The platform features in the proposed plug module with multiple molds incorporated, facilitating the preparation of cell encapsulated 3-D hydrogel constructs in a precise and efficient manner. This trait is found particularly useful for high-precision and high-throughput micro 3-D cell culture-based assay. In this study, the real value of the proposed platform to maintain a stable and homogenous culture condition was discussed. Besides, the application of the presented platform for precisely investigating the effect of serum concentration on the metabolic activities and biosynthetic abilities of articular chondrocytes was also demonstrated. As a whole, the proposed device has paved an alternative route to carry out high throughput micro-scale 3-D perfusion cell culture in a simple, cost-effective and precise manner. The promising applications include 3-D cell culture-based high throughput drug or toxicity testing/screening, or other investigations on the cell biology, where the precise quantification of the links between the cellular responses and extracellular conditions is required.
Acute and chronic toxicity toward the bacteria Vibrio fischeri of organic narcotics and epoxides: structural alerts for epoxide excess toxicity.	The acute and chronic bacterial toxicity of 34 organic compounds comprising 19 baseline narcotics and 15 epoxides has been determined with regard to 30-min bioluminescence and 24-h growth inhibition in terms of EC50 (effective concentration 50%) values employing Vibrio fischeri. For the narcotics, linear regression of log EC50 on log Kow (octanol/water partition coefficient) yields r2 (squared correlation coefficient) and rms (root-mean-square error) values of 0.95 and 0.44 (30-min), and 0.94 and 0.34 (24-h), respectively. Employing the resultant baseline narcosis models, toxicity enhancement (Te) values were derived as a ratio of narcosis-predicted over experimental EC50 for the epoxides. For seven aliphatic epoxides, log Te was below 1 in both assays, indicating narcosis-range toxicity with regard to 30-min bioluminescence and 24-h growth inhibition. Concerning eight nonaliphatic epoxides, log Te values up to 2.4 were observed, reflecting excess toxicity through an enhanced electrophilic reactivity of the compounds. Here, however, the intercorrelation between both assays was very low (r2 = 0.09). The results are discussed in terms of electronic substituent effects activating an SN2-type epoxide reaction with nucleophilic protein sites and side-chain activation offering alternative electrophile-nucleophile reaction routes at side-chain sites, leading to respective structural alerts as indicators of excess toxicity. Surprisingly, 30-min bioluminescence appears to be slightly more sensitive to chemical stress than 24-h growth, which holds both for baseline narcotics and for most of the epoxides. This is also reflected by effective narcosis doses 50%, ED50, of 7.1 mmol/kg (30-min) and 7.7 mmol/kg (24-h) estimated from narcosis theory. Keeping in mind the different end points (bioluminescence vs growth) involved, this finding demonstrates that chronic toxicity is not always more sensitive than acute toxicity, calling for analyses with regard to further respective cases and associated mechanistic causes.
Safety and pharmacokinetics of intrathecal administration of pemetrexed in rats.	Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is a devastating complication of malignant disease. In this study, we evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of intrathecally administered pemetrexed in rats.
Current assessment of the effects of environmental chemicals on the mammary gland in guideline rodent studies by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and National Toxicology Program (NTP).	Evaluation of the structural and/or functional integrity of the mammary gland (MG) across life stages is integral to the assessment of developmental, reproductive, and carcinogenic risk for environmental chemicals.
Determination of exposure multiples of human metabolites for MIST assessment in preclinical safety species without using reference standards or radiolabeled compounds.	A simple, reliable, and accurate method was developed for quantitative assessment of metabolite coverage in preclinical safety species by mixing equal volumes of human plasma with blank plasma of animal species and vice versa followed by an analysis using high-resolution full-scan accurate mass spectrometry. This approach provided comparable results (within (±15%) to those obtained from regulated bioanalysis and did not require synthetic standards or radiolabeled compounds. In addition, both qualitative and quantitative data were obtained from a single LC-MS analysis on all metabolites and, therefore, the coverage of any metabolite of interest can be obtained.
Overview of the marmoset as a model in nonclinical development of pharmaceutical products.	Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset) is one of the more primitive non-human primate species and is used widely in fundamental biology, pharmacology and toxicology studies. Marmosets breed well in captivity with good reproductive efficiencies and their sexual maturity is reached within 18 months of age allowing for rapid expansion of colonies and early availability of sexually mature animals permitting an earlier assessment of product candidates in the adult. Their relatively small size allows a reduction in material requirements leading to a reduction in development time and cost. Fewer animals are also required due to their ability to be used in both pharmacology and toxicology (nonclinical) studies. These factors, alongside a better understanding of their optimal nutrient and welfare requirements over recent years, facilitate the generation of a more cohesive and robust dataset. With the growth of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals, non-human primate use has, by necessity, also increased; nevertheless, there is also a growing public call for minimizing their use. Utilizing, the more primitive marmoset species may provide the optimal compromise and once the scientific rationale has been carefully considered and their use justified, there are several advantages to using the marmoset as a model in nonclinical development of pharmaceutical products.
Chlorinated benzenes cause concomitantly oxidative stress and induction of apoptotic markers in lung epithelial cells (A549) at nonacute toxic concentrations.	In industrialized countries, people spend more time indoors and are therefore increasingly exposed to volatile organic compounds that are emitted at working places and from consumer products, paintings, and furniture, with chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) being representatives of the halogenated arenes. To unravel the molecular effects of low concentrations typical for indoor and occupational exposure, we exposed human lung epithelial cells to CB and DCB and analyzed the effects on the proteome level by 2-D DIGE, where 860 protein spots were detected. A set of 25 and 30 proteins were found to be significantly altered due to exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of 10(-2) g/m(3) of CB or 10(-3) g/m(3) of DCB (2.2 and 0.17 ppm), respectively. The most enriched pathways were cell death signaling, oxidative stress response, protein quality control, and metabolism. The involvement of oxidative stress was validated by ROS measurement. Among the regulated proteins, 28, for example, voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 2, PDCD6IP protein, heat shock protein beta-1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, nucleophosmin, seryl-tRNA synthetase, prohibitin, and protein arginine N-methyltransferase 1, could be correlated with the molecular pathway of cell death signaling. Caspase 3 activation by cleavage was confirmed for both CB and DCB by immunoblotting. Treatment with CB or DCB also caused differential protein phosphorylation, for example, at the proteins HNRNP C1/C2, serine-threonine receptor associated protein, and transaldolase 1. Compared to previous results, where cells were exposed to styrene, for the chlorinated aromatic substances besides oxidative stress, apoptosis was found as the predominant cellular response mechanism.
DIGE-based protein expression analysis of B[a]P-exposed hepatoma cells reveals a complex stress response including alterations in oxidative stress, cell cycle control, and cytoskeleton motility at toxic and subacute concentrations.	Although the effects of high concentrations of the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) have been studied extensively, little is known about its effects at subacute toxic concentrations, which are typical for environmental pollutants. We exposed murine Hepa1c1c7 cells to a toxic concentration (5 μM) and a subacute concentration (50 nM) of B[a]P over a period of 2-24 h to differentiate between acute and pseudochronic effects and conducted a time-course analysis of B[a]P-influenced protein expression by DIGE. In total, a set of 120 spots were found to be significantly altered due to B[a]P exposure of which 112 were subsequently identified by mass spectrometry. Clustering and principal component analysis were conducted to identify sets of proteins responding in a concerted manner to the exposure. Our results indicate an immediate response to the contaminant at the protein level and demonstrate that B[a]P exposure alters the cellular response by disturbing proteins involved in oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and cytoskeleton organization. Furthermore, network analysis of protein-protein interactions revealed a complex network of interacting, B[a]P-regulated proteins mostly belonging to the cytoskeleton organization and several signal transduction pathways.
Heat shock enhances CMV-IE promoter-driven metabotropic glutamate receptor expression and toxicity in transfected cells.	In CHO-K1 cells, heat shock strongly activated reporter-gene expression driven by the cytomegalovirus immediate-early (CMV-IE) promoter from adenoviral and plasmid vectors. Heat shock treatment (2h at 42.5 °C) significantly enhanced the promoter DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts. In CHO cells expressing mGluR1a and mGluR5a receptors under the control of the CMV promoter, heat shock increased receptor protein expression, mRNA levels and receptor function estimated by measurement of PI hydrolysis, intracellular Ca²+ and cAMP. Hyperthermia increased average amplitudes of Ca²+ responses, the number of responding cells, and revealed the toxic properties of mGluR1a receptor. Heat shock also effectively increased the expression of EGFP. Hence, heat shock effects on mGluR expression and function in CHO cells may be attributed to the activation of the CMV promoter. Moreover, this effect was not limited to CHO cells as heat shock also increased EGFP expression in PC-12 and HEK293 cells. Heat shock treatment may be a useful tool to study the function of proteins expressed in heterologous systems under control of the CMV promoter. It may be especially valuable for increasing protein expression in transient transfections, for enhancing receptor expression in drug screening applications and to control the expression of proteins endowed with toxic properties. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Trends in neuropharmacology: in memory of Erminio Costa'.
Anti-barnacle activity of novel simple alkyl isocyanides derived from citronellol.	Twenty novel simple alkyl isocyanides derived from citronellol were synthesized and evaluated for their antifouling activity and toxicity against cypris larvae of the barnacle, Balanus amphitrite. The anti-barnacle activity of the synthesized isocyanides was in the EC(50) range of 0.08-1.49 μg ml(-1). Simple isocyanides containing a benzoate and chloro group showed the most potent anti-barnacle activity. In addition, none of the synthesized compounds showed significant toxicity and LC(50) values were <10 μg ml(-1). The LC(50)/EC(50) ratios of almost all of the synthesized compounds were >10(2). The results indicate that these simple isocyanides are promising low-toxicity antifouling agents.
Fluorine--a current literature review. An NRC and ATSDR based review of safety standards for exposure to fluorine and fluorides.	A review of the literature of the element fluorine and its bonded-form, fluoride, was undertaken. Generally regarded as safe, an expanding body of literature reveals that fluoride's toxicity has been unappreciated, un-scrutinized, and hidden for over 70 years. The context for the literature search and review was an environmental climate-change study, which demonstrated widespread fluoride contamination by smokestack emissions from coal-fired electricity-generating plants. The objective of this review is to educate and inform regarding the ubiquitous presence and harmful nature of this now ever-present corrosive and reactive toxin.
Screening the toxic potential of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii strains isolated from Lake Balaton, Hungary.	Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is becoming a major concern among cyanobacteria, due to its potential ability to produce toxic metabolites. We assessed the cytotoxic potential of four C. raciborskii strains (ACT 9502, ACT 9503, ACT 9504 and ACT 9505) isolated from Lake Balaton (Hungary), by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage measurements and by detecting morphological alterations in CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells. The Australian AQS (cylindrospermopsin producer) strain of C. raciborskii and purified cylindrospermopsin (CYN) were used as positive references in both the biochemical and morphological studies. Chemical analysis for known cyanotoxins was performed on aqueous extracts of ACT and AQS strains by the HPLC-MS technique. Comparing threshold values of LDH leakage data, different toxic potentials of cyanobacterial extracts are suggested in short term (3 h) and long (24 h) exposure regimes. In the acute (3 h) experiments the aqueous extract of the ACT 9505 strain proved to be most toxic (EC(50) = 7.4 mg mL(-1)), while after 24 h the ACT 9504 extract was the most effective (EC(50) = 0.65 mg mL(-1)). The extract of the AQS strain and the purified CYN exerted most of their toxic effects after 3 h exposure (EC(50) = 0.74 mg mL(-1), and 0.9 μg mL(-1) respectively). The morphological changes of CHO-K1 cells induced by the crude extracts of the ACT strains included fragmentation of the actin filaments then relocation of the depolymerized actin to the perinuclear region, resulting cell rounding and loss of adhesion. Exposure of CHO-K1 cells to the crude extract of the AQS strain, moreover, resulted cell shrinking and formation of filopodia, i.e. distinctly different cytological alterations from that induced by the ACT extracts and the purified CYN. Chemical analysis of the cyanobacterial crude extracts confirmed the presence of cylindrospermopsin in the extract of the AQS strain (8.5 mg CYN g(-1) dry weight), and none of the presently known cyanotoxins have been analytically confirmed in the extracts of the ACT strains isolated from the Lake Balaton. Although a significant toxicity of all four ACT C. raciborskii strains is confirmed by both biochemical and morphological studies, our results also pointed out the necessity of further studies to identify the toxic, but still unknown metabolic components produced by these cyanobacterial members of the phytoplankton communities.
Toxic effects of a high dose of non-ionic iodinated contrast media on renal glomerular and aortic endothelial cells in aged rats in vivo.	Iodinated contrast media (CM) can induce apoptosis and necrosis of renal tubular cells. The injuries of endothelial cells induced by CM on the systemic condition have not been fully understood. To assess the toxic effects of non-ionic CM on the glomerular and aortic endothelial cells, iopromide and iodixanol, two kinds of representative non-ionic CM, were used for the in vivo study. Sixty aged rats were respectively received the agents or normal sodium intravascularly. No obvious apoptosis and morphological change was detected in the glomerular and aortic endothelial cells apart from renal tubules after CM administration. However, expressions of the nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in glomerular endothelium were decreased at 12h after CM injection. Furthermore, plasma creatinine and endothelin-1 were increased and plasma nitric oxide (NO) was decreased significantly after CM administration. However, we failed to observe the significant increase of plasma von Willebrand Factor. These results suggest that non-ionic iodinated CM do not induce apoptosis and necrosis of glomerular and aortic endothelial cells in vivo. Decreased eNOS expression and increased plasma endothelin-1 may be involved in non-ionic iodinated CM-induced endothelial dysfunction and kidney injury.
Transgenic animals and the study of cancer.	This chapter seeks to outline the strategies being employed to exploit transgenic mice as a tool in the study of cancer. Rather than catalog the many different oncogene and oncogene-promoter combinations that have been introduced into transgenic mice to elicit tumors, I will concentrate on a single system that epitomizes the general approach. That system, pioneered by Philip Leder of Harvard University, is mammary carcinogenesis induced by oncogene expression directed by the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) enhancer-promoter.
In vitro evaluation of total venom-antivenin immune complex formation and binding parameters relevant to antivenin protection against venom toxicity and lethality based on size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography.	Total venom-antivenin immune complex formation and binding parameters relevant to antivenin protection against venom toxicity and lethality can be evaluated using size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC). Simple integration of regions within SE-HPLC elution profiles was used to compare binding characteristics of Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (Ovine) antivenin (FabAV) and Crotalus atrox (western diamondback rattlesnake; C. atrox), C. varidis varidis (prairie rattlesnake; C. v. v.), Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix (southern copperhead; A. c. c.), and A. piscivorus leukostoma (western cottonmouth; A. p. l.) venom. Areas associated with bound venom and antivenin ({Area(bnd)}) were evaluated using a logistic dose-response equation to estimate EC(50) and {Area(bnd)}(max). The relative magnitudes of EC(50), which inversely reflect venom-antivenin binding affinity, were C. atrox > C. v. v. > A. c. c. > A. p. l. Less than 50% of FabAV appeared to be reactive with each of the venoms based on {Area(bnd)}(max). Data was also consistent with FabAV binding to multiple sites on polyvalent antigens within the venoms. Evaluation of immune complex formation using SE-HPLC was compared to neutralization of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activity of C. atrox, A. c. c., and A. p. l. venom by FabAV as reported in the literature. Maximum neutralization of PLA(2) activity occurred, in general, prior to maximum immune complex formation. Venom-antivenin binding at EC(50) determined via SE-HPLC appeared to be greater than binding associated with neutralization of venom lethality in mice based on LD(50) and ED(50) reported by others. SE-HPLC analysis of venom-antivenin binding could provide a priori information, relevant to reducing the use of animals in evaluating antivenin protection against venom-induced toxicity and lethality.
In vitro safety pharmacology profiling: what else beyond hERG?	One of the main reasons for drug failures in clinical development, or postmarket launch, is lacking or compromised safety margins at therapeutic doses. Organ toxicity with poorly defined mechanisms and adverse drug reactions associated with on- and off-target effects are the major contributors to safety-related shortfalls of many clinical drug candidates. Therefore, to avoid high attrition rates in clinical trials, it is imperative to test compounds for potential adverse reactions during early drug discovery. Beyond a small number of targets associated with clinically acknowledged adverse drug reactions, there is little consensus on other targets that are important to consider at an early stage for in vitro safety pharmacology assessment. We consider here a limited number of safety-related targets, from different target families, which were selected as part of in vitro safety pharmacology profiling panels integrated in the drug-development process at Novartis. The best way to assess these targets, using a biochemical or a functional readout, is discussed. In particular, the importance of using cell-based profiling assays for the characterization of an agonist action at some GPCRs is highlighted. A careful design of in vitro safety pharmacology profiling panels allows better prediction of potential adverse effects of new chemical entities early in the drug-discovery process. This contributes to the selection of the best candidate for clinical development and, ultimately, should contribute to a decreased attrition rate.
Bacterial decolorization and detoxification of black liquor from rayon grade pulp manufacturing paper industry and detection of their metabolic products.	This study deals with the decolorization of black liquor (BL) by isolated potential bacterial consortium comprising Serratia marcescens (GU193982), Citrobacter sp. (HQ873619) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (GU193983). The decolorization of BL was studied by using the different nutritional as well as environmental parameters. In this study, result revealed that the ligninolytic activities were found to be growth associated and the developed bacterial consortium was efficient for the reduction of COD, BOD and color up to 83%, 74% and 85%, respectively. The HPLC analysis of degraded samples of BL has shown the reduction in peak area compared to control. Further, the GC-MS analysis showed that, most of the compounds detected in control were diminished after bacterial treatment while, formic acid hydrazide, 4-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, carbamic acid, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid and erythropentanoic acid were found as new metabolites. Further, the seed germination test using Phaseolus aureus has supported the detoxification of bacterial decolorized BL.
Epigenetic screening in product safety assessment: are we there yet?	There has been a growing concern that epigenetic events, that is, heritable changes in gene expression superimposed on DNA nucleotide sequences, may be involved in chemically and/or nutritionally mediated adverse health outcomes, such as reproductive toxicity and cancer. This concern has been driven by an increasing number of studies reporting toxicant-induced alterations to the epigenome in the form of changes in DNA methylation, histone/chromatin remodeling, and altered expression of non-coding RNAs. These three major mechanisms of epigenetic modifications may have coordinated, independent, or potentially antagonistic influences on gene expression. Complicating this understanding is the incomplete understanding of the normal state and dynamic variation of the epigenome, which differs widely between cells, tissues, developmental state, age, strain, and species. This review serves as a framework to outline characteristics composing an ideal epigenetic screen(s) for hazard identification in product safety assessment. In order to implement such a screen, first there needs to be a better understanding of adaptive versus adverse changes in the epigenome, which includes identification of robust and reproducible causal links between epigenetic changes and adverse apical end points, and second development of improved reporter assay tools to monitor such changes. An ideal screen would be in vitro-based, medium- to high-throughput, and assess all three branches of epigenome control (i.e. methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs), although also being quantitative, objective, portable (i.e. lab to lab), and relevant to humans.
Preparation and evaluation of a new nano pharmaceutical excipients and drug delivery system based in polyvinylpyrrolidone and silicate.	This work describes the preparation of new nanocomposites based on lamellar silicates (AAM-alkyl ammonium montmorillonite) obtained by the intercalation of PVP K30 and glyceril monostearate.
Isolation and identification of acaricidal compounds in Inula japonica (Asteraceae).	We identified acaricidal compounds in Inula japonica Thunberg (Asteraceae) that were effective against carmine spider mite, Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval). Petroleum-ether extracts from I. japonica were toxic to T. cinnabarinus, with a 50% lethal concentration (LC50) value of 1.18 mg/ml. Silica gel column chromatography was used to separate the acaricidal components. Seventeen of 38 fraction groups had mite mortality rates >50%, nine fraction groups had rates >60%, and three fraction groups had rates >80% at 2 mg/ml. The major volatile compounds in the bioactive fraction groups were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and beta-sitosterol (1), stigmasterol (2), lupeol (3), and alpha-amyrin (4) were identified and determined to have acaricidal activity against T. cinnabarinus in vitro.
Cobweb management and control of the spider Holocnemus pluchei (Araneae: Pholcidae) on buildings.	The spider Holocnemus pluchei (Scopoli) (Araneae: Pholcidae) is a nonnative species commonly found in the southwestern United States. In urban areas around homes and other structures, it is often the dominant spider species on outside surfaces; requests for control of spiders and their cobwebs are common for the commercial pest management industry. We tested two physical (brushing and vacuuming) and two low-impact chemical (permethrin and botanical insecticide) spray control methods for H. pluchei on outbuildings on the University of California-Riverside campus. Forty sites containing at least two H. pluchei spiders along a 5-m section of eave or overhang were chosen for treatment. Treatment was applied within 2 d of a pretreatment census. The number of spiders per section was counted at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 52 wk posttreatment. Untreated sections showed an increase in spiders through summer and a decrease in autumn. Sites treated with permethrin significantly reduced spiders >95% and had strong residual effect throughout the remainder of the sampling period. Compared with untreated controls, the three other treatments did not significantly reduce spiders; these three were similar throughout the season and were intermediate between untreated and permethrin-treated sites. In comparison with the before and 2-wk posttreatments, spiders at the untreated sites showed no difference in body sizes, whereas those in the nonpermethrin treatments showed a decrease, indicating that larger spiders were eliminated. We also tested H. pluchei spiders in the laboratory against the two insecticides used in the field studies to determine the minimum lethal concentrations for controlling H. pluchei.
Toxicity of betulin derivatives and in vitro effect on promastigotes and amastigotes of Leishmania infantum and L. donovani.	The toxicity and antileishmanial activity of 20 betulin derivatives were studied. The toxicity of betulin and synthesized compounds was determined using a bacterial test (Microtox) and two mammalian cell lines (CHO-K1 and J774). The antileishmanial activity of compounds (50  μM) was examined in both the promastigote and intracellular amastigote stages of Leishmania infantum and L. donovani. No correlation was found among the toxicity tests. All the compounds showed significant antipromastigote activity. The antiproliferative capacity of derivatives was dependent on the parasite stage studied, and no substantial differences were found between Leishmania species. Betulin, 3,28-di-O-acetylbetulin and L-aspartyl amide of betulonic acid showed moderate activity against amastigotes. The highest inhibition of intracellular amastigote multiplication was achieved with a low micromolar concentration (IC(50) ca 9  μM) of heterocyclic betulin derivative 3,28-di-O-acetyllup-13(18)-ene with N-ethyltriazolo moiety 16, without significant toxicity for mammalian cells. These results point to the interest of this lead compound for further in vitro and in vivo tests.
Toxicity of botanical insecticides on golden apple snail (Pomacea canaliculata).	The molluscicidal activity of crude extracts from five highly potential plants, Annona squamosa seed, Nerium indicum Leaves, Stemona tuberose root, Cyperus rotundus corm and Derris elliptica root was assessed to Pomacea canaliculata. D. elliptica root and C. rotundus corm extracts showed the highest toxicity against 3-month old snails which have LC50 as 23.68 +/- 2.96 mg/l and 133.20 +/- 7.94 mg/l, respectively. The C. rotundus corm extracts were chosen for detoxification enzyme in vivo assay which shows esterase and glutathione S-transferase activity in stomach, intestinal tracts and digestive glands of survival treated P. canaliculata were inhibited.
Investigation on possible ecotoxicological risk of carbofuran insecticides.	Carbofuran-containing insecticides are widely used agents in plant protection. Their use may pose considerable environmental risk for both the protected and non-protected predator and plantivorous birds. For defence of wild birds a model experiment was carried out on broiler chickens. In the study, eight animals were treated orally by gastric tube with a carbofuran-containing insecticide at a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg b.w. One animal served as untreated control specimen. Forage and drinking water were provided ad libitum. After the treatment, the possible clinical signs were observed carefully, blood samples were obtained from each bird and after exsanguinations liver, breast and leg muscle samples and stomach content were taken. The carbofuran concentration in blood, tissues and stomach content was determined by gas chromatographic method. Thirty minutes after poisoning, the average carbofuran concentration in breast muscle of chickens exceeded the maximum level of 0.1 mg/kg permitted in edible tissues, whereas ninety minutes after poisoning the concentration of one sample was still above the limit value. In the liver, leg-muscle and blood samples, the measured carbofuran concentration was lower than the permitted maximum value, except in the blood of two animals. The carbofuran concentration of the stomach content markedly exceeded the limit value. The sublethal concentration of the pesticides can reduce the capable of living of wild animals. Due to the sub toxic dose the poisoned birds can survive; however, the residue of insecticides can lead to secondary toxicosis of other animals.
Investigation of correlation among safety biomarkers in serum, histopathological examination, and toxicogenomics.	This article addresses the issue of miscorrelation between hepatic injury biomarkers and histopathological findings in the drug development context. Our studies indicate that the use of toxicogenomics can aid in the drug development decision-making process associated with such miscorrelated data. BLZ945 was developed as a Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor. Treatment of BLZ945 in rats and monkeys increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). However, liver hypertrophy was the only histopathological liver finding in rats, and there was no change in the livers of monkeys. Longer treatment of BLZ945 in rats for 6 weeks caused up to 6-fold elevation of ALT, yet hepatocyte necrosis was not detected microscopically. Toxicogenomic profiling of liver samples demonstrated that the genes associated with early response to liver injury, apoptosis/necrosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic enzymes were upregulated. Studies are ongoing to evaluate the mechanisms underlying BL945-induced ALT and AST elevations.
Bioassays as a tool for evaluating advanced oxidation processes in water and wastewater treatment.	Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been widely used in water and wastewater treatment for the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants as well as to improve biodegradability of industrial wastewater. Unfortunately, the partial oxidation of organic contaminants may result in the formation of intermediates more toxic than parent compounds. In order to avoid this drawback, AOPs are expected to be carefully operated and monitored, and toxicity tests have been used to evaluate whether effluent detoxification takes place. In the present work, the effect of AOPs on the toxicity of aqueous solutions of different classes of contaminants as well as actual aqueous matrices are critically reviewed. The dualism toxicity-biodegradability when AOPs are used as pre-treatment step to improve industrial wastewater biodegradability is also discussed. The main conclusions/remarks include the followings: (i) bioassays are a really useful tool to evaluate the dangerousness of AOPs as well as to set up the proper operative conditions, (ii) target organisms for bioassays should be chosen according to the final use of the treated water matrix, (iii) acute toxicity tests may be not suitable to evaluate toxicity in the presence of low/realistic concentrations of target contaminants, so studies on chronic effects should be further developed, (iv) some toxicity tests may be not useful to evaluate biodegradability potential, in this case more suitable tests should be applied (e.g., activated sludge bioassays, respirometry).
Final report on the safety assessment of Cocos nucifera (coconut) oil and related ingredients.	Cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, oil from the dried coconut fruit, is composed of 90% saturated triglycerides. It may function as a fragrance ingredient, hair conditioning agent, or skin-conditioning agent and is reported in 626 cosmetics at concentrations from 0.0001% to 70%. The related ingredients covered in this assessment are fatty acids, and their hydrogenated forms, corresponding fatty alcohols, simple esters, and inorganic and sulfated salts of coconut oil. The salts and esters are expected to have similar toxicological profiles as the oil, its hydrogenated forms, and its constituent fatty acids. Coconut oil and related ingredients are safe as cosmetic ingredients in the practices of use and concentration described in this safety assessment.
Final report of the safety assessment of cosmetic ingredients derived from Zea mays (corn).	Many cosmetic ingredients are derived from Zea mays (corn). While safety test data were not available for most ingredients, similarities in preparation and the resulting similar composition allowed extrapolation of safety data to all listed ingredients. Animal studies included acute toxicity, ocular and dermal irritation studies, and dermal sensitization studies. Clinical studies included dermal irritation and sensitization. Case reports were available for the starch as used as a donning agent in medical gloves. Studies of many other endpoints, including reproductive and developmental toxicity, use corn oil as a vehicle control with no reported adverse effects at levels used in cosmetics. While industry should continue limiting ingredient impurities such as pesticide residues before blending into a cosmetic formulation, the CIR Expert Panel determined that corn-derived ingredients are safe for use in cosmetics in the practices of use and concentration described in the assessment.
Amended safety assessment of Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil, hydrogenated sesame seed oil, Sesamum indicum (sesame) oil unsaponifiables, and sodium sesameseedate.	Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil and related cosmetic ingredients are derived from Sesamum indicum. Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil, sesamum indicum (sesame) oil unsaponifiables, and hydrogenated sesame seed oil function as conditioning agents. Sodium sesameseedate functions as a cleansing agent, emulsifying agent, and a nonaqueous viscosity increasing agent. These ingredients are neither skin irritants, sensitizers, teratogens, nor carcinogens at exposures that would result from cosmetic use. Both animal and human data relevant to the cosmetic use of these ingredients were reviewed. The CIR Expert Panel concluded that these ingredients are safe in the present practices of use and concentration as described in this safety assessment.
Final report of the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel safety assessment of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), methyl methacrylate crosspolymer, and methyl methacrylate/glycol dimethacrylate crosspolymer.	Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and related cosmetic ingredients methyl methacrylate crosspolymer and methyl methacrylate/glycol dimethacrylate crosspolymer are polymers that function as film formers and viscosity-increasing agents in cosmetics. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determination of safety of PMMA use in several medical devices, which included human and animal safety data, was used as the basis of safety of PMMA and related polymers in cosmetics by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel.  The PMMA used in cosmetics is substantially the same as in medical devices.  The Panel concluded that these ingredients are safe as cosmetic ingredients in the practices of use and concentrations as described in this safety assessment.
Cytotoxicity tests of water soluble ZnS and CdS quantum dots.	Cytotoxicity tests of zinc sulfide (ZnS) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) quantum dots (QDs) synthesized via all-aqueous process with various surface conditions were carried out with human endothelial cells (EA hy926) using two independent viability assays, i.e., by cell counting following Trypan blue staining and by measuring Alamar Blue (AB) fluorescence. The ZnS QDs with all four distinct types of surface conditions were nontoxic at both 1 microM and 10 microM concentrations for at least 6 days. On the other hand, the CdS QDs were nontoxic only at 1 microM, and showed significant cytotoxicity at 10 microM after 3 days in the cell counting assay and after 4 days in the AB fluorescence assay. The CdS QDs with (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPS)-replacement plus silica capping were less cytotoxic than those with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) capping and those with MPS-replacement capping. Comparing the results of ZnS and CdS QDs with the same particle size, surface condition and concentration, it is indicated that the cytotoxicity of CdS QDs and the lack of it in ZnS QDs were probably due to the presence and absence of the toxic Cd element, respectively. The nontoxicity of the aqueous ZnS QDs makes them favorable for in vivo imaging applications.
Thai plants from Doi Tung: brine shrimp lethality, antioxidative activity and combination effect with L-ascorbic acid.	Methanolic extracts of 18 Thai plants from Doi Tung, the north of Thailand, were examined for brine shrimp lethality and antioxidative activity using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. In brine shrimp lethality, the highly toxic plant extracts were Mitrephora wangii (LC(50) 14.8 µg mL(-1)) and Hydrocotyle javanica (LC(50) 13.3 µg mL(-1)). The extracts of Sageretia cordifolia, Ulmus lancaefolia and Acer chiangdaoense exhibited highly antioxidative activities with IC(50) values of 6.7, 8.1 and 9.8 µg mL(-1), respectively. Moreover, the extracts of S. cordifolia, U. lancaefolia and A. chiangdaoense have shown slightly synergistic effects (combination index; CI < 1) with L-ascorbic acid on DPPH radicals. A number of plants demonstrated either brine shrimp lethality or free radical scavenging activity.
Cytotoxic effects of nasal buserelin on nasal mucosal tissue in rabbits.	To investigate the cytotoxic effects of nasal buserelin on rabbit nasal mucosal tissue, twenty-four female rabbits were studied prospectively. The rabbits were divided into 4 groups including 6 rabbits. The rabbits' left noses were included in the all study groups: 150 μg/puff/day of buserelin acetate was administered topically twice daily during 21, 42 and 63 days. Saline was administered topically twice daily to the left nasal cavity in the control group. The nasal septal mucosal stripe tissue was carefully removed from underlaying cartilage after sedation. HE staining, Masson's trichrome, toluidine blue and TUNEL staining were used to evaluate mucosal changes. Each preparation was investigated via apoptotic cells, and they were accounted. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to evaluate nonparametric comparison of apoptotic cells. Mononuclear cells have been raised in the sub-epithelial connective tissue, nucleuses of epithelial cells in the apical region were pyknotic, and apoptotic cells were determined on 21-day group. In the 42-day group, nasal epithelial tissue was similar to 21-day group and epithelial cells including pyknotic nucleus were present in this group, too. In the 63-day group, epithelial cells were light colored. Venous sinuses in the sub-epithelial connective tissue were wide but not congested and not raised collagen filaments. In the intra-epithelial tissue, some of cells were TUNEL (+). Apoptotic cells were fewer in the control group according to 21-day group. In 42- and 63-day groups, these cells were fewer than in 21-day group. Numerical difference was present between the groups, but statistical significance was not found between the groups. We concluded that nasal buserelin cytotoxicity was not potent in the nasal cavity in rabbits. We use nasal buserelin in all indications with confidence.
Quantitative redox biology: an approach to understand the role of reactive species in defining the cellular redox environment.	Systems biology is now recognized as a needed approach to understand the dynamics of inter- and intra-cellular processes. Redox processes are at the foundation of nearly all aspects of biology. Free radicals, related oxidants, and antioxidants are central to the basic functioning of cells and tissues. They set the cellular redox environment and, therefore, are the key to regulation of biochemical pathways and networks, thereby influencing organism health. To understand how short-lived, quasi-stable species, such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and nitric oxide, connect to the metabolome, proteome, lipidome, and genome we need absolute quantitative information on all redox active compounds as well as thermodynamic and kinetic information on their reactions, i.e., knowledge of the complete redoxome. Central to the state of the redoxome are the interactive details of the superoxide/peroxide formation and removal systems. Quantitative information is essential to establish the dynamic mathematical models needed to reveal the temporal evolution of biochemical pathways and networks. This new field of Quantitative Redox Biology will allow researchers to identify new targets for intervention to advance our efforts to achieve optimal human health. 
Genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of doxycycline in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes.	Doxycycline (DOX) is a broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic used in the treatment of many infections. In this study, the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of DOX in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes were investigated by measuring chromosome aberrations (CAs), cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay, mitotic index (MI), and nuclear division index (NDI). Cultures were treated with DOX at three concentrations (2, 4, and 6 µg/mL) for 48 hours. Mitomycin C (MMC) was used as a positive control. All the tested concentrations of DOX for MI and the higher concentrations (4 and 6 µg/mL) for NDI significantly decreased mitotic activity. However, there are no significant differences between negative control and all the tested concentrations of DOX for CA and MN frequencies. In conclusion, our results indicate that DOX has a cytotoxic effect, but not a genotoxic effect, on human peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures. Further detailed studies, especially about the cell-cycle kinetics of DOX, are required to elucidate the decreases in dividing cells and make a possible risk assessment on cells of patients receiving therapy with this drug. Further, if the specific cytostatic and cytotoxic potential of DOX to different types of cancer cells is investigated in detail, it may also have been used as an antitumoral drug.
Evaluation of the toxicity of 2-aminoimidazole antibiofilm agents using both cellular and model organism systems.	Biofilm formation is a ubiquitous bacterial defense mechanism and has been shown to be a primary element in the antibiotic resistance of many human diseases, especially in the case of nosocomial infections. Recently, we have developed several compound libraries that are extremely effective at both dispersing preexisting biofilms and also inhibiting their initial formation. In addition to their antibiofilm properties, some of these molecules are able to resensitize resistant bacterial strains to previously ineffective antibiotics and are being assessed as adjuvants. In this study, we evaluated the toxic effects of three of our most effective 2-aminoimidazole compounds (dihydrosventrin, RA, and SPAR) using a rapid pipeline that combines a series of assays. A methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium assay, using the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line was used to determine epidermal irritants and was combined with Caenorhabditis elegans fecundity assays that demonstrated the effects of environmental exposure to various concentrations of these molecules. In each case, the assays showed that the compounds did not exhibit toxicity until they reached well above their current biofilm dispersion/inhibition concentrations. The most effective antibiofilm compound also had significant effects when used in conjunction with several standard antibiotics against resistant bacteria. Consequently, it was further investigated using the C. elegans assay in combination with different antibiotics and was found to maintain the same low level of toxicity as when acting alone, bolstering its candidacy for further testing as an adjuvant.
Preparation and irradiation of Pluronic F127-based thermoreversible and mucoadhesive hydrogel for local delivery of naproxen.	To improve physical properties and modulate the mucoadhesive hydrogel formulation via cross-linking by radiation, hydrogels were prepared using thermoreversible polymer Pluronic F127 (PF127) and mucoadhesive polymer carbopol 934P (C934P). As a model drug, naproxen was loaded in the hydrogel formulation. Sol-gel transition temperatures of hydrogels were measured by the tube-inversion method. The mucoadhesive potential of each formulation was determined by measuring the force required to detach the formulation from oral mucosal tissue. To strengthen the mechanical properties, the formulations were irradiated using an electronic beam. Drug release from the hydrogels and the cytotoxicity of each formulation were investigated. Sol-gel transition temperatures of the formulations were decreased by the addition of carbopol and were close to body temperature. The mucoadhesive force of the PF127 formulation was increased by addition of carbopol. In vitro release was sustained and the release rate was reduced by the addition of carbopol. After irradiation, the mucoadhesive force was increased about five-fold especially in the case of PF127 23% (9.7 kPa) and in vitro release was not sustained further. In conclusion, the use of a PF127 formulation incorporating a mucoadhesive polymer could effectively and safely improve oral residence time and absorption of naproxen. Irradiated formulations showed permanent cross-linking and improved properties. 
Copper toxicity to Lemna minor modelled using humic acid as a surrogate for the plant root.	Humic acids are chemically analogous to plant root cell walls in that their surface sites are principally comprised of carboxylic and phenolic acids which bind both metals and protons. Based on this analogy, we developed a biotic-ligand type of model to predict Cu toxicity to Lemna minor, using particulate humic acid (HA(part)) of the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM), and 7d static-renewal exposures with five surface waters and one nutrient media which varied in DOC (1-10 mg L(-1)), pH (6.9-8.7), and water hardness (35-236 mg equivalent CaCO(3)L(-1)). Although the range of waters tested resulted in a 36-fold variation in 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, the calculated concentration of Cu bound to HA(part) using this framework was highly correlated with pooled percent net root elongation (%NRE) (R(2)=0.95). Ten and fifty percent IC values based on [Cu-HA(part)] were additionally within a factor of ±1.5 and ±1.4, respectively, inclusive of 95% confidence limits. This model construct, which defines the free metal ion and the first hydrolysis product (but not metal carbonate complexes) as being bioavailable, provides an alternative means of defining the binding surface in bioavailability models, whereby a heterogeneous mixture of ligands collectively influence root-metal sorption and toxicity.
Developmental toxicity study of lersivirine in mice.	Lersivirine is a second-generation nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor undergoing clinical development for the treatment of HIV-1. An embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study was performed to evaluate the maternal and developmental toxicity of lersivirine in pregnant mice. Mated Crl:CD1(ICR) mice were administered 0, 150, 350, and 500 mg/kg lersivirine once daily by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 17, followed by cesarean section on gestation day 18. The first 2 days of dosing for the high-dose group were done at 250 mg/kg to allow induction of hepatic metabolizing enzymes, after which the dose was increased to 500 mg/kg/day. This dosing paradigm allowed for maintenance of exposure in the high-dose group despite the considerable autoinduction that occurs in rodents following lersivirine treatment. Lersivirine did not cause an increase in external, visceral, or skeletal malformations. Intrauterine growth retardation, demonstrated by reduced fetal body weights and increased variations associated with delayed skeletal ossification, was noted at 350 and 500 mg/kg/day. The results of these studies indicate that lersivirine is not teratogenic in mice.
Toxicity assessment of 45 pesticides to the epigeic earthworm Eisenia fetida.	This study was conducted to investigate comparative toxicity of 45 pesticides, including insecticides, acaricides, fungicides, and herbicides, toward the epigeic earthworm Eisenia fetida. Results from a 48-h filter paper contact test indicated that clothianidin, fenpyroximate, and pyridaben were supertoxic to E. fetida with LC(50) values ranging from 0.28 (0.24-0.35) to 0.72 (0.60-0.94) μg cm(-2), followed by carbaryl, pyridaphenthion, azoxystrobin, cyproconazole, and picoxystrobin with LC(50) values ranging from 2.72 (2.22-0.3.19) to 8.48 (7.38-10.21) μg cm(-2), while the other pesticides ranged from being relatively nontoxic to very toxic to the worms. When tested in artificial soil for 14 d, clothianidin and picoxystrobin showed the highest intrinsic toxicity against E. fetida, and their LC(50) values were 6.06 (5.60-6.77) and 7.22 (5.29-8.68) mg kg(-1), respectively, followed by fenpyroximate with an LC(50) of 75.52 (68.21-86.57) mgkg(-1). However, the herbicides fluoroglycofen, paraquat, and pyraflufen-ethyl exhibited the lowest toxicities with LC(50) values>1000 mg kg(-1). In contrast, the other pesticides exhibited relatively low toxicities with LC(50) values ranging from 133.5 (124.5-150.5) to 895.2 (754.2-1198.0) mg kg(-1). The data presented in this paper provided useful information for evaluating the potential risk of these chemicals to soil invertebrates.
Developmental toxicity evaluations of whole mixtures of disinfection by-products using concentrated drinking water in rats: gestational and lactational effects of sulfate and sodium.	A developmental toxicity bioassay was used in three experiments to evaluate water concentrates for suitability in multigenerational studies. First, chlorinated water was concentrated 135-fold by reverse osmosis; select lost disinfection by-products were spiked back. Concentrate was provided as drinking water to Sprague-Dawley and F344 rats from gestation day 6 to postnatal day 6. Maternal serum levels of luteinizing hormone on gestation day 10 were unaffected by treatment for both strains. Treated dams had increased water consumption, and increased incidences of polyuria, diarrhea, and (in Sprague-Dawley rats) red perinasal staining. Pup weights were reduced. An increased incidence of eye defects was seen in F344 litters. Chemical analysis of the concentrate revealed high sodium (6.6 g/l) and sulfate (10.4 g/l) levels. To confirm that these chemicals caused polyuria and osmotic diarrhea, respectively, Na₂SO₄ (5-20 g/l) or NaCl (16.5 g/l) was provided to rats in drinking water. Water consumption was increased at 5- and 10-g Na₂SO₄/l and with NaCl. Pup weights were reduced at 20-g Na₂SO₄/l. Dose-related incidences and severity of polyuria and diarrhea occurred in Na₂SO₄-treated rats; perinasal staining was seen at 20 g/l. NaCl caused polyuria and perinasal staining, but not diarrhea. Subsequently, water was concentrated ∼120-fold and sulfate levels were reduced by barium hydroxide before chlorination, yielding lower sodium (≤1.5 g/l) and sulfate (≤2.1 g/l) levels. Treatment resulted in increased water consumption, but pup weight and survival were unaffected. There were no treatment-related clinical findings, indicating that mixtures produced by the second method are suitable for multigenerational testing.
Methoxychlor-induced ovarian follicle toxicity in mice: dose and exposure duration-dependent effects.	Methoxychlor (MXC) is specifically known to target ovarian antral follicles, increasing atresia (death via apoptosis) in them. This is of concern because females are born with a finite pool of ovarian follicles. Only limited studies have explored the phenomenon of a reduced fertility threshold for effect based on the percentage of antral follicle atresia.
Developmental toxicity of lersivirine in rabbits when administered throughout organogenesis and when limited to sensitive windows of axial skeletal development.	Lersivirine is a second-generation nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor undergoing clinical development for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1. An embryo-fetal development study was performed to evaluate the potential for maternal and developmental toxicity of lersivirine.
New bolus models for in vivo efficacy testing of mycotoxin-detoxifying agents in relation to EFSA guidelines, assessed using deoxynivalenol in broiler chickens.	In this study, three new models were developed for efficacy testing of mycotoxin-detoxifying agents in relation to recent European guidelines. In the first model, deoxynivalenol was given to broiler chickens as an intra-crop bolus together with a mycotoxin-detoxifying agent in order to study the plasma concentration-time profile of deoxynivalenol. In the second model, the same oral bolus was given, preceded by an oral bolus of mycotoxin-detoxifying agent, to make sure the detoxifying agent was present in the whole intestinal tract when the mycotoxin was administered. In the third model, the mycotoxin-detoxifying agent was mixed in the feed of broiler chickens, and after 1 week's feeding, deoxynivalenol was given as an oral bolus. In order to evaluate the efficacy of these agents, plasma concentration-time profiles were set up and the main toxicokinetic parameters were compared. Two commercially available mycotoxin-detoxifying agents were tested, but they were not able to lower the oral availability of deoxynivalenol. As a positive control, activated carbon was used. We showed that activated carbon significantly reduces the absorption and oral availability of deoxynivalenol in all three models. Therefore, it can be concluded that these models are able to demonstrate the efficacy of mycotoxin-detoxifying agents in relation to European Food Safety Authority guidelines.
Nitrate-induced photodegradation of atenolol in aqueous solution: kinetics, toxicity and degradation pathways.	The extensive utilization of β-blockers worldwide led to frequent detection in natural water. In this study the photolysis behavior of atenolol (ATL) and toxicity of its photodegradation products were investigated in the presence of nitrate ions. The results showed that ATL photodegradation followed pseudo-first-order kinetics upon simulated solar irradiation. The photodegradation was found to be dependent on nitrate concentration and increasing the nitrate from 0.5 mML(-1) to 10 mML(-1) led to the enhancement of rate constant from 0.00101 min(-1) to 0.00716 min(-1). Hydroxyl radical was determined to play a key role in the photolysis process by using isopropanol as molecular probe. Increasing the solution pH from 4.8 to 10.4, the photodegradation rate slightly decreased from 0.00246 min(-1) to 0.00195 min(-1), probably due to pH-dependent effect of nitrate-induced .OH formation. Bicarbonate decreased the photodegradation of ATL in the presence of nitrate ions mainly through pH effect, while humic substance inhibited the photodegradation via both attenuating light and competing radicals. Upon irradiation for 240 min, only 10% reduction of total organic carbon (TOC) can be achieved in spite of 72% transformation rate of ATL, implying a majority of ATL transformed into intermediate products rather than complete mineralization. The main photoproducts of ATL were identified by using solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS) techniques and possible nitrate-induced photodegradation pathways were proposed. The toxicity of the phototransformation products was evaluated using aquatic species Daphnia magna, and the results revealed that photodegradation was an effective mechanism for ATL toxicity reduction in natural waters.
Photolysis of flumequine: identification of the major phototransformation products and toxicity measures.	Direct photolysis of flumequine (FLU, 20 mg L(-1)) in different types of water (demineralised water (DW) and synthetic seawater (SW)), was conducted in a Suntest CPS+solar simulator to evaluate its persistence and toxicity, and to identify the major phototransformation products (PTPs) generated during photolysis in DW. It was observed that FLU is susceptible to transformation when subjected to direct solar radiation. The composition of the water affects the FLU degradation kinetics, which is slower in SW. Photolytic transformation products generated during direct photolysis were identified by liquid chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS). Fourteen PTPs generated in DW were identified. The transformation of FLU begins with the opening of the heterocyclic ring by oxidation of the double bond. Loss of the fluorine atom and the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring also appear as the majority, especially in the early stages. Comparative acute toxicity evaluation by Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna bioassays was performed for the first and last irradiated solutions in both matrices studied. These bioassays demonstrated that in the SW matrix, the most persistent PTPs are highly toxic to D. magna but less so to V. fischeri.
Paradigm shift in toxicity testing and modeling.	The limitations of traditional toxicity testing characterized by high-cost animal models with low-throughput readouts, inconsistent responses, ethical issues, and extrapolability to humans call for alternative strategies for chemical risk assessment. A new strategy using in vitro human cell-based assays has been designed to identify key toxicity pathways and molecular mechanisms leading to the prediction of an in vivo response. The emergence of quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) technology has proved to be an efficient way to decompose complex toxicological end points to specific pathways of targeted organs. In addition, qHTS has made a significant impact on computational toxicology in two aspects. First, the ease of mechanism of action identification brought about by in vitro assays has enhanced the simplicity and effectiveness of machine learning, and second, the high-throughput nature and high reproducibility of qHTS have greatly improved the data quality and increased the quantity of training datasets available for predictive model construction. In this review, the benefits of qHTS routinely used in the US Tox21 program will be highlighted. Quantitative structure-activity relationships models built on traditional in vivo data and new qHTS data will be compared and analyzed. In conjunction with the transition from the pilot phase to the production phase of the Tox21 program, more qHTS data will be made available that will enrich the data pool for predictive toxicology. It is perceivable that new in silico toxicity models based on high-quality qHTS data will achieve unprecedented reliability and robustness, thus becoming a valuable tool for risk assessment and drug discovery.
Use of TSHβ:EGFP transgenic zebrafish as a rapid in vivo model for assessing thyroid-disrupting chemicals.	Accumulating evidence indicates that a wide range of chemicals have the ability to interfere with the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Novel endpoints should be evaluated in addition to existing methods in order to effectively assess the effects of these chemicals on the HPT axis. Thyroid-stimulating hormone subunit β (TSHβ) plays central regulatory roles in the HPT system. We identified the regulatory region that determines the expression level of zebrafish TSHβ in the anterior pituitary. In the transgenic zebrafish with EGFP driven by the TSHβ promoter, the similar responsive patterns between the expression levels of TSHβ:EGFP and endogenous TSHβ mRNA in the pituitary are observed following treatments with goitrogen chemicals and exogenous thyroid hormones (THs). These results suggest that the TSHβ:EGFP transgenic reporter zebrafish may be a useful alternative in vivo model for the assessment of chemicals interfering with the HPT system.
Web tools for predictive toxicology model building.	The development and use of web tools in chemistry has accumulated more than 15 years of history already. Powered by the advances in the Internet technologies, the current generation of web systems are starting to expand into areas, traditional for desktop applications. The web platforms integrate data storage, cheminformatics and data analysis tools. The ease of use and the collaborative potential of the web is compelling, despite the challenges.
In vitro and in vivo toxicity of rinsed and aged nanocellulose-polypyrrole composites.	Novel composites of nanocellulose and the conducting polymer polypyrrole (PPy) are herein suggested as potential candidates for active ion-extraction membranes in electrochemically controlled hemodialysis. This study has defined processing parameters to obtain a biocompatible nanocellulose-PPy composite, and for the first time, the effect of the composite aging on cell viability has been studied. The influence of rinsing and extraction process steps, as well as aging under different conditions (i.e. in air, at -20°C and in argon), on the electroactivity and cytotoxicity of a PPy-nanocellulose composite has been investigated. The biocompatibility evaluation was based on indirect toxicity assays with fibroblasts and monocyte cell lines and an acute toxicity test in mice, while the electroactivity was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry experiments. The as-prepared composite did not induce any cytotoxic response in vitro or in vivo. Extensive rinsing and 48 h incubation in biological buffer previous to the preparation of the culture medium extracts were, however, necessary to obtain a noncytotoxic composite. The as-prepared composite was also found to exhibit acceptable electrochemical performance, which was retained upon 4 weeks storage in argon atmosphere. It was shown that aging of the composite had a negative effect on biocompatibility, regardless of the storage condition. Thus, to allow for longtime storage of electroactive nanocellulose-PPy hemodialysis membranes, the degradation of PPy upon storage must be controlled. The present results show that the biocompatibility of PPy composites depends on the rinsing and pretreatment of the composite material as well as the aging of the material.
Preclinical toxicity profile of oral bilastine.	As part of the bilastine development program, and as mandated by regulatory authorities, several studies were performed with oral bilastine in different animal species to evaluate its toxicity profile. Toxicokinetic analyses conducted in tandem to evaluate systemic exposure, gender differences, and dose proportionality in the different animal species indicated that animals were systemically exposed to bilastine during treatment. Repeated-dose toxicity studies in beagle dogs (52 weeks) and in rats and mice (13 weeks) showed that bilastine at doses up to 2,000 mg/kg/day was not associated with any mortality, ocular effects, or nodules/masses. Likewise, no bilastine-associated neoplastic lesions were observed in rats and mice after 104 weeks of treatment with bilastine at doses up to 2,000 mg/kg/day. In general, bilastine-related clinical signs, body-weight changes, food consumption, clinical chemistry, haematology, and macro- and microscopic findings were of low order and reversible, with effects present only at the highest doses administered. Bilastine (up to 1,000 mg/kg/day) was well tolerated in pregnant/lactating rats and in their offspring and subsequent generations. With respect to effects on embryofoetal development in rabbits, bilastine at 400 mg/kg/day (the highest dose evaluated) was assessed to be the no observed adverse effects level. Overall, bilastine demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile in all animal models investigated and at higher doses than the corresponding recommended daily human dosage.
Toward a blended ontology: applying knowledge systems to compare therapeutic and toxicological nanoscale domains.	Bionanomedicine and environmental research share need common terms and ontologies. This study applied knowledge systems, data mining, and bibliometrics used in nano-scale ADME research from 1991 to 2011. The prominence of nano-ADME in environmental research began to exceed the publication rate in medical research in 2006. That trend appears to continue as a result of the growing products in commerce using nanotechnology, that is, 5-fold growth in number of countries with nanomaterials research centers. Funding for this research virtually did not exist prior to 2002, whereas today both medical and environmental research is funded globally. Key nanoparticle research began with pharmacology and therapeutic drug-delivery and contrasting agents, but the advances have found utility in the environmental research community. As evidence ultrafine aerosols and aquatic colloids research increased 6-fold, indicating a new emphasis on environmental nanotoxicology. User-directed expert elicitation from the engineering and chemical/ADME domains can be combined with appropriate Boolean logic and queries to define the corpus of nanoparticle interest. The study combined pharmacological expertise and informatics to identify the corpus by building logical conclusions and observations. Publication records informatics can lead to an enhanced understanding the connectivity between fields, as well as overcoming the differences in ontology between the fields.
Lipoic acid mitigates bisphenol A-induced testicular mitochondrial toxicity in rats.	Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the highest volume chemicals produced worldwide. BPA is used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins used in manufacturing plastic baby bottles and lining of food cans. In this study, we investigated the BPA-induced testicular oxidative stress and perturbation of mitochondrial marker enzymes in male albino rats and its amelioration by α-lipoic acid (LA). Rats were administered a dose of BPA (10 mg/kg body weight) orally for 14 days. This resulted in decreased testes weight, total testicular protein content, testicular enzymes such as acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase and decline in activities of marker mitochondrial enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, monoamine oxidase and NADH dehydrogenase. The serum testosterone and total antioxidant status were reduced. Besides, it also affected the activities of testicular antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase. BPA also caused lipid peroxidation and decrease in reduced glutathione content of mitochondria. The co-administration of LA (20 mg/kg body weight; orally for 14 days) together with BPA resulted in restoration of the mitochondrial marker enzyme activities and increasing enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants of mitochondria. The obtained results demonstrated that LA has a potential role in mitigating BPA-induced mitochondrial toxicity through antioxidant mechanism or by direct free radical scavenging activity.
Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of Satureja spicigera and its main compounds.	Satureja spicigera (Lamiaceae) grows wildly in Northwest of Iran. In this study, bioassay-guided isolation and identification of the main compounds has been reported using various chromatographic methods and comparison of their spectral data with those reported in the literature. Brine shrimp lethality and four cancerous cell lines HT29/219, Caco(2), NIH-3T3, and T47D were used for cytotoxicity evaluations. From the aerial parts of S. spicigera, nine known compounds including two flavanones, 5,7,3',5'-tetrahydroxy flavanone (8) and 5,4'-dihydroxy-3'-methoxyflavanone-7-(6''-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl)-β-D-glucopyranoside (9), one dihydrochalcone, nubigenol (7), together with thymoquinone (1), thymol (2), carvacrol (3), β-sitosterol (4), ursolic acid (5) and oleanolic acid (6) were identified. Among the isolated chalcone and flavanones, compound 8 was effective against Artemia salina larva (LC(50)= 2 μg/mL) and only the compound 9 demonstrated IC(50) value of 98.7 μg/mL on the T47D (human, breast, ductal carcinoma). Other compounds did not show significant inhibition of the cell growth.
Solar photocatalytic treatment of landfill leachate using a solid mineral by-product as a catalyst.	The treatment of municipal solid waste landfill leachate in a pilot plant made up of solar compound parabolic collectors, using a solid industrial titanium by-product (WTiO(2)) containing TiO(2) and Fe(III) as a photocatalyst, was investigated. In the study evidence was found showing that the degradation performed with WTiO(2) was mainly due to the Fe provided by this by-product, instead of TiO(2). However, although TiO(2) had very little effect by itself, a synergistic effect was observed between Fe and TiO(2). The application of WTiO(2), which produced coupled photo-Fenton and heterogeneous catalysis reactions, achieved a surprisingly high depuration level (86% of COD removal), higher than that reached by photo-Fenton using commercial FeSO(4) (43%) in the same conditions. After the oxidation process the biodegradability and toxicity of the landfill leachate were studied. The results showed that the leachate biodegradability was substantially increased, at least in the first stages of the process, and again that WTiO(2) was more efficient than FeSO(4) in terms of increasing biodegradability.
Proliferative and nonproliferative lesions of the rat and mouse urinary system.	The INHAND Project (International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria for Lesions in Rats and Mice) is a joint initiative of the Societies of Toxicologic Pathology from Europe (ESTP), Great Britain (BSTP), Japan (JSTP), and North America (STP) to develop an internationally accepted nomenclature for proliferative and nonproliferative lesions in laboratory animals. The purpose of this publication is to provide a standardized nomenclature for classifying lesions observed in the urinary tract of rats and mice. The standardized nomenclature of urinary tract lesions presented in this document is also available electronically on the Internet (http://www.goreni.org/). Sources of material included histopathology databases from government, academia, and industrial laboratories throughout the world. Content includes spontaneous developmental and aging lesions as well as those induced by exposure to test materials. A widely accepted and utilized international harmonization of nomenclature for urinary tract lesions in laboratory animals will decrease confusion among regulatory and scientific research organizations in different countries and provide a common language to increase and enrich international exchanges of information among toxicologists and pathologists.
International harmonization of toxicologic pathology nomenclature: an overview and review of basic principles.	The International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria for Lesions in Rats and Mice is a global project that is publishing criteria for both proliferative and nonproliferative changes in laboratory animals. This paper presents a set of general suggestions for terminology across systems. These suggestions include the use of diagnostic versus descriptive terms, modifiers, combination terms, and grading systems; and the use of thresholds, synonyms, and terminology for some processes that are common to several organ systems. The purpose of this paper is to help the reader understand some of the basic principles underlying the International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria for Lesions in Rats and Mice process.
Proliferative and nonproliferative lesions of the rat and mouse central and peripheral nervous systems.	Harmonization of diagnostic nomenclature used in the pathology analysis of tissues from rodent toxicity studies will enhance the comparability and consistency of data sets from different laboratories worldwide. The INHAND Project (International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria for Lesions in Rats and Mice) is a joint initiative of four major societies of toxicologic pathology to develop a globally recognized nomenclature for proliferative and nonproliferative lesions in rodents. This article recommends standardized terms for classifying changes observed in tissues of the mouse and rat central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems. Sources of material include academic, government, and industrial histopathology databases from around the world. Covered lesions include frequent, spontaneous, and aging-related changes as well as principal toxicant-induced findings. Common artifacts that might be confused with genuine lesions are also illustrated. The neural nomenclature presented in this document is also available electronically on the Internet at the goRENI website (http://www.goreni.org/).
Gastric hairballs in rabbits: significance in developmental toxicity study.	We surveyed 1053 pregnant rabbits of the Kbl:NZW strain collected from 27 developmental toxicity studies to reveal the prevalence and significance of gastric hairballs. The incidence of hairballs was 2/525 (0.4%) in the control group and 17/528 (3.2%) in the high dose group. In the high dose group, 16 dams resulted in abortion or death. In addition, decreases in body weight and food consumption were more severe in dams with hairballs than in their group-mates without hairballs.
Human induced pluripotent stem cells--from mechanisms to clinical applications.	Human pluripotent stem cells hold great promise for basic research and regenerative medicine due to their inherent property to propagate infinitely, while maintaining the potential to differentiate into any given cell type of the human body. Since the first derivation in 1998, pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been studied intensively, and although these cells provoke ethical and immune rejection concerns, translation of human ESC research into the clinics has been initiated. The generation of embryonic stem cell-like human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells by virus-mediated overexpression of distinct sets of reprogramming factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC, or OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28) in 2007 has opened up further opportunities in the field. While circumventing the major disputes associated with human ESCs, iPSCs offer the same advantages and, in addition, new perspectives for personalized medicine. This review summarizes technical advances toward the generation of potentially clinically relevant human iPSCs. We also highlight key molecular events underlying the process of cellular reprogramming and discuss inherent features of iPSCs, including genome instability and epigenetic memory. Furthermore, we will give an overview of particular envisaged human iPSC applications and point out which improvements are yet to come and what has been achieved so far.
Cell type-dependent uptake, localization, and cytotoxicity of 1.9 nm gold nanoparticles.	This follow-up study aims to determine the physical parameters which govern the differential radiosensitization capacity of two tumor cell lines and one immortalized normal cell line to 1.9 nm gold nanoparticles. In addition to comparing the uptake potential, localization, and cytotoxicity of 1.9 nm gold nanoparticles, the current study also draws on comparisons between nanoparticle size and total nanoparticle uptake based on previously published data.
Commentary on the role of maternal toxicity on developmental toxicity.	Maternal mammalian toxicity impacts prenatal development, with general systemic maternal toxicity, from reduced weight gain to morbidity, causative for reduced fetal weights/litter and increased fetal variations (especially skeletal)/litter, but not, in the author's opinion, for increased fetal malformations, reduced litter sizes or full litter losses. Increased fetal malformations are likely due to exposure to specific chemicals which alter specific maternal functions at critical point(s) in pregnancy, typically exaggerated effects from higher doses by drugs under development with known, desired pharmacological effects. Malformations can also be from genetic/epigenetic alterations, specific altered proteins, molecular pathways, etc. Full litter losses are triggered by the mother and are rare in rats. Information to inform maternal (and developmental) toxicity includes ovarian corpora lutea counts, uterine implantation profile, degree of litter reduction (if present), timing and extent of maternal toxicity relative to those of adverse embryofetal effects, etc. The view of maternal toxicity as confounding results in in vivo developmental toxicity studies, worldwide concerns about increased research animal usage, increasing time, labor, costs, and new software and hardware sophistication all drive the interest in development, validation, and performance of in vitro/in silico assays. These assays are fast, inexpensive, responsive to animal use concerns and amenable to mechanistic questions. The strength of these in vitro/in silico assays is considered by many to be the absence of the maternal organism/placenta. These assays inform mechanism and hazard, but NOT risk. The Environmental Protection Agency currently estimates that these new assays are approximately 70% accurate versus the whole animal tests.
To the substantiation of the maximum allowable concentrations of the herbicide dalzlak-T in ambient air]	The paper presents the results of experimental studies of the reflectory and resorptive effects of different concentrations of the herbicide Dalzlak-T in ambient air. Hygienic regulations have been first developed and a hazard class for the agent has been defined to estimate ambient air pollution during its manufacture, storage, transportation, and agricultural application.
Biocompatibility of alpha-calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CSH)/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites for bone reconstruction application]	We examined the biocompatibility and the safety of a-calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CSH)/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites for bone reconstruction application. The biocompatibility of the CSH/MWCNT composites was evaluated by the measures which taking L929 fibroblast cells cultured in the extracted liquid of the composite soaking solution and putting bone marrow stromal cells planted on the composite pellets in vitro, respectively. The cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT test and further observed using an inverted optical microscope and a scanning electric microscope. The toxicity of the composites was evaluated by acute and subacute systemic toxicity test. Long-term muscle and bone implantation in vivo tests were also conducted. L929 fibroblast cells grew well in the extracted liquid, as well as bone marrow stromal cells that could adhere on the surface of sample pellets and proliferated rapidly. MTT test showed that there were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups (P > 0.05). In vivo test manifested that the composites were no toxicity, no irritation to skin and good for bone defect reconstruction. It was proved that a-calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CSH)/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites exhibited excellent biocompatibility for the potential application in bone tissue engineering.

Serum kinetics, distribution and excretion of silver in rabbits following 28 days after a single intravenous injection of silver nanoparticles.	Serum kinetics, tissue distribution, and excretion of citrate-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were investigated in rabbits (n = 4) up to 28 days after a single intravenous injection. Following a single injection of AgNPs, the AUC(last) was reported to be 3.65 ± 0.68 μg·day/ml in 5 mg/kg-treated group and 0.90 ± 0.16 μg·day/ml in 0.5 mg/kg-treated group, respectively. The accumulation of silver was observed in all the tested organs including liver, kidney, spleen, lung, brain, testis, and thymus at 1 day, 7 day, and 28 day of measurement. The liver and spleen seemed to be the major targets because of high accumulation of silver. Excretion via feces and urine was also monitored during the entire experimental period. Unexpectedly, much more excretion of silver occurred via feces than through urine after an intravenous injection, which suggests biliary excretion of AgNPs. General toxicity was analyzed and histopathological changes were also evaluated.
Investigation of heavy metal pollution of trees in a contaminated industrial area in the north of Iran.	Phytoremediation is the technology of purging soils and water systems from heavy pollutant metals. Cadmium is one of the heavy elements, which is environmentally important due to its toxicity to humans and animals. Toxicity and accumulation of cadmium in body organs through eating contaminated food has an important role in endangering human's health. To this end, trees of buttonwood were prepared and irrigated with nutrient solution containing cadmium chloride in 10, 15 and 20 mM for 12 months. Then the root, stem and leaf samples were harvested and the amounts of cadmium element in stem, root and leaf organs together with the growth parameters were measured. This study determined the amount of cadmium accumulated by Platanus occidentalis. Furthermore, the comparison between accumulation and transfer of cadmium in the study showed that absorption of this metal by the root is more than its amount in stem and leaf. The result of this research shows that buttonwood has the potential for cadmium accumulation without any serious damage to its growth. Regarding the extent of contaminated industrial areas, petrochemical industry, power plants and vast contaminated municipal areas, there is a great need for planting fast-growing and tolerant plants like buttonwood.
Recent advances in benefits and hazards of engineered nanoparticles.	Over recent decades, engineered nanoparticles are increasingly produced as the result of the rapid development in nanotechnology. They are currently used in a wide range of industrial and public sectors including healthcare, agriculture, transport, energy, materials, and information and communication technologies. As the result, an increasing concern has been raised over the potential impacts of engineered nanoparticles to human health. In the light of this, it is the purpose of the present review to discuss: (1) novel properties of engineered nanoparticles particularly in biomedical sciences, (2) most recently reported adverse effects of manufactured nanoparticles on human health and (3) different aspects of toxicological risk assessment of these nanoparticles.
A panel of biological tests reveals developmental effects of pharmaceutical pollutants on late stage zebrafish embryos.	Standard toxicological assays using the zebrafish model system evaluate lethality and teratogenicity upon exposure during the first 2 days after fertilization. We tested the biological effects of several widely used drugs on zebrafish by acute treatment for 24 h starting at late embryonic stages, between 48 and 72 h post-fertilization. For 4 out of 6 compounds, we observed a higher sensitivity of late stage zebrafish embryos for general toxicity (lethality) compared to younger embryos. Morphological defects such as edema, body curvature, delayed growth, decreased heart rate and locomotion were observed for each of the compounds tested, often at sublethal concentrations. Gene expression studies on a set of four selected genes revealed a specific regulatory pattern for the different compounds tested. Our results allow us to compare various toxicological endpoints and may contribute to the design of a rational high throughput approach using the zebrafish model.
Recent progress in studies of metallic nickel and nickel-based nanoparticles' genotoxicity and carcinogenicity.	Recently, nanoparticles have been the focus of many research and innovation. Metallic nickel and nickel-based nanoparticles are among those being exploited. Nickel fine particles are known to be genotoxic and carcinogenic. It has been discovered that many properties of nano sized elements and materials are not present in their bulk states. The nano size of these particles renders them the ability to be easily transported into biological systems, thus raising the question of their effects on the susceptible system. Therefore scientific research on the effects of nickel nanoparticles is important. This mini-review intends to summarize the current knowledge on the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity potential of metallic nickel and nickel-based nanoparticles implicated in in vitro and in vivo mammalian studies.
CdO nanoparticle toxicity on growth, morphology, and cell division in Escherichia coli.	This Article deals with the toxicological study of synthesized CdO nanoparticles (NPs) on Escherichia coli . Characterization of the CdO NPs was done by DLS, XRD, TEM, and AFM studies, and the average size of NPs was revealed as 22 ± 3 nm. The NPs showed bactericidal activity against E. coli. When NPs were added at midlog phase of growth, complete growth inhibitory concentration was found as 40 μg/mL. Bacterial cells changed morphological features to filamentous form with increasing CdO NPs exposure time, and thereafter resulted in filamentation-associated clumping. From AFM study, severe damage of the cell surface was found in CdO NPs-treated cells. CdO NPs were found to interfere with the expression level of two conserved cell division components, ftsZ and ftsQ, in E. coli at both transcriptional and translational levels. Interference of CdO NPs in proper septum formation without affecting the nucleoid segregation was also observed in confocal micrographs. The elevated intracellular oxidative stress due to CdO NPs exposure seems to be one of the reasons for the changes in cell morphology and expression of division proteins in E. coli.
Cytotoxicity of phenol red in toxicity assays for carbon nanoparticles.	To explore the novel properties of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) in nanotoxicity assays, the adsorption of phenol red (a pH indicator for culture medium) by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and three kinds of carbon blacks (CBs) with nanosize, and its effects on cytotoxicity were studied. Results indicated that the phenol red adsorbed and delivered into cells by CBs was responsible for the toxicity to Hela cells in the medium without serum. The cellular uptake of phenol red was verified using 125I-labeling techniques. The size-dependent cytotoxicity of CBs was found to closely correlate to adsorption of phenol red, cellular uptake of phenol red-CB complexes and the amount of phenol red delivered into the cells by CBs. Although the CBs were either nontoxic or slightly toxic, as vehicles of phenol red, they played an essential role in the cytotoxicity induced by phenol red. However, MWNTs showed an intrinsic cytotoxicity independent of phenol red. The implications associated with these findings are discussed.
Reproductive and neurobehavioral effects of brilliant blue FCF in mice.	Brilliant blue FCF of food color was given in the diets of mice at levels of 0% (control), 0.08, 0.24, and 0.72% from 5 weeks of age in the F(0)  generation and continuing to 11 weeks of age in the F(1)  generation and selected reproductive and neurobehavioral parameters were measured. Mice were mated at 9 weeks of age and dams were delivered offspring at 12 weeks of age. Offspring were weaned at 4 weeks of age. Regarding exploratory behavior at 8 weeks of age in the F(0)  generation, movement time (sec) displayed a significant tendency to be increased and the average time of rearing (sec) displayed a significant tendency to be decreased in females in the treatment groups in a trend test (p = 0.019 and 0.027, respectively). In the F(1)  generation, the development of surface righting at postnatal day 4 was delayed significantly in the high-dose group (0.72%) in male and female offspring, and those effects were significantly related to dose in a trend test (p< 0.01 for both). Regarding exploratory behavior at 8 weeks of age in the F(1)  generation, the number of horizontal activities exhibited a significant tendency to be decreased in females in the treatment groups in a trend test (p = 0.015). Regarding spontaneous behavior, average time of movement (sec) was significantly accelerated in females in the high-dose group. The dose levels of brilliant blue FCF used in the present study produced a few significant effects on neurobehavioral parameters in multiple generations in mice.
Quantum dots: heralding a brighter future for clinical diagnostics.	Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals that possess unique optical properties including broad-range excitation, size-tunable narrow emission spectra and high photostability, giving them considerable value in various biomedical applications. The size and composition of QDs can be varied to obtain the desired emission properties and make them amenable to simultaneous detection of multiple targets. Furthermore, numerous surface functionalizations can be used to adapt QDs to the needed application. The successful use of QDs has been reported in the areas of in vitro diagnostics and imaging. There is also potential for multimodal applications for simultaneous imaging. Toxicity issues are still a prime concern with regards to in vivo applications on account of the toxic constituents of QDs.

ABT-874 is an anti-IL-12/23 monoclonal antibody that binds to the p40 subunit of human IL-12 and IL-23. As part of its preclinical safety assessment, studies were conducted to assess its potential effects on pre- and postnatal development in cynomolgus monkeys.
Male and female fertility assessment in the cynomolgus monkey following administration of ABT-874, a human Anti-IL-12/23p40 monoclonal antibody.	ABT-874 is an anti-IL-12/23 monoclonal antibody that binds to the p40 subunit of human IL-12 and IL-23. As part of its preclinical safety assessment, studies were conducted to asses its potential effects on the reproductive system in male and female cynomolgus monkeys.
Screening, isolation, taxonomy and fermentation of an antibiotic producer Streptomyces xinghaiensis from soil capable of acting against linezolid resistant strains.	Linezolid resistant cultures are emerging in hospitals. In the present study 3 soil actinomycetes were isolated in a screening programme having potential to produce antibiotic against linezolid resistant cases. One culture was coded as RK-46 and further studied. The micromorphology, biochemical tests and 16S ribosomal DNA gene sequence analysis were conducted to know the identity of the culture and was found as a strain of Streptomyces xinghaiensis. The culture produced antibiotic active against five clinical resistant strains. The antibiotic production was tested by cultivating in eleven different media. The fermentation profile was studied in YEME medium supplemented with calcium carbonate. The maximum activity was noticed at 72 h. Antibiotic activity was extracted into ethyl acetate and was subjected to activity guided purification by column chromatography, TLC and HPLC methods. The pure compound was eluted with retention time of 6.8 min and subjected to 1H, 13C NMR and Mass spectral analysis. The acquired data was compared with that in natural products data base, and was found to be a known antibiotic, reductiomycin. The purified compound showed activity against 5 linezolid resistant cultures and on Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This compound is also showing mild anti cancer activity and is biologically permeable as per Lipinksi's rule.
The development of statistical models to determine the relationship between aromatic-ring class profile and repeat-dose and developmental toxicities of high-boiling petroleum substances.	The repeat-dose and developmental toxicities of certain petroleum refinery streams are related to their polycyclic aromatic compound (PAC) content (Feuston et al., 1994). Building on this foundation, and working within the context of the US EPA High Production Volume (HPV) Chemical Challenge Program, we: (1) characterized relationships between PAC content and repeat-dose and developmental toxicities of high boiling petroleum substances (HBPS), and (2) developed statistical models that can be used to predict critical effects of similar untested substances. Data from 39 dermal toxicity studies of HBPS were used to develop statistical models to predict the dose-response relationships between the weight percent concentration of each of their 1-7 aromatic ring classes and 4 repeat-dose and 3 developmental endpoints (absolute thymus weight, hemoglobin count, platelet count, liver to body weight, live fetus count, fetal weight, and percent resorptions). The correlations between the observed and model-predicted values are >0.90. The predictive ability of the models was tested via a series of evaluation or corroboration methods. As is shown in the paper, using only compositional data of untested HBPS, the models can be used to predict the effect at a given dose or the dose that causes an effect of a stipulated magnitude. 
Assessing the mammalian toxicity of high-boiling petroleum substances under the rubric of the HPV program.	In 1998, the US EPA announced the HPV Challenge Program, a voluntary chemical data collection effort. The Petroleum HPV Testing Group (PHPVTG(1)) volunteered to provide data on approximately 110 high boiling petroleum substances (HBPS), i.e. substances with final boiling points ≥ approximately 650°F (343°C). These HBPS are substances of unknown and variable composition (UVCBs) that are composed of numerous individual constituents. Toxicity studies have shown that some HBPS can produce systemic (repeat-dose) and developmental effects, and some are mutagenic under in vitro conditions. The papers in this supplement show that these effects are related to the profiles of aromatic constituents in these substances. Further, it is shown that the effects on selected repeat-dose and developmental toxicity endpoints and mutagenic activity in bacterial assays can be predicted from compositional information using models based on the aromatic-ring class profile, "ARC profile" as defined by gas chromatographic separation of the DMSO-soluble fraction of the starting materials. This chromatographic method and the predictive models provide an efficient means of characterizing for screening purposes the potential for repeat-dose, developmental effects and bacterial mutagenicity of HBPS and can reduce the number of animal tests that would be required if these tests were conducted on all 110 HBPS.
Neutralizing activity and protective immunity to ricin toxin conferred by B subunit (RTB)-specific Fab fragments.	SylH3 and 24B11 are murine monoclonal antibodies directed against different epitopes on ricin toxin's binding (RTB) subunit that have been shown to passively protect mice against ricin challenge. Here we report that Fab fragments of SylH3 and 24B11 neutralize ricin in a cell based assay, and in a mouse challenge model as effectively as their respective full length parental IgGs. These data demonstrate that immunity to ricin can occur independent of Fc-mediated clearance. 
A nonclinical safety assessment of MnTE-2-PyP, a manganese porphyrin.	Manganese (III) meso-tetrakis(N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP or BMX-010; CASRN 219818-60-7) is a manganese porphyrin compound developed as a potential drug substance for use as a radioprotective and for the ex vivo treatment of cells, tissues, and organs intended for transplantation. In preparation for an investigational new drug filing, a full good laboratory practice nonclinical safety assessment was conducted in order to evaluate the safety of MnTE-2-PyP and included the performance of in vitro genotoxicity studies, local tissue tolerance evaluation, safety pharmacology core battery studies, and single- and repeat-dose intravenous (iv) toxicity studies in mice and monkeys. The MnTE-2-PyP was determined not to be genotoxic or hemolytic, did not demonstrate flocculation or elicit adverse pharmacologic effects on respiration, the central nervous system (CNS), and had limited transitory effects on the cardiovascular system only at levels well above the therapeutic target dose. The intended iv clinical solution did not cause venous irritation in rabbits. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in mice was determined to be 10 mg/kg/day after 18 consecutive days of bolus iv dosing once daily in the morning. The NOAEL in monkeys after 14 days of bolus iv dosing in the morning was determined to be 5 mg/kg/day. At doses relevant to clinical use in humans, neither study revealed any indication of any specific target organ toxicity, including the classic heme porphyrin kidney, liver, CNS, or cardiac toxicities, or manganese toxicity. Mortality seen shortly after dosing in individual animals at higher doses was not accompanied by any organ or clinical pathology indications, suggesting a functional pharmacological-mediated effect. Based on the results of these studies, a conservative safe initial starting clinical dose of 5.0 mg (0.083 mg/kg in a 60 kg adult) was proposed for the initiation of human trials. Because of patent life issues, use of MnTE-2-PyP as a transplantation aid or radioprotective agent is not currently being pursued past the preclinical stages. It serves as a model for the clinical development of this class of drugs. 
In vitro PFOS exposure on immune endpoints in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and mice.	Previous studies in our lab have shown that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) modulates immune function in mice and correlates with many immune parameters in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). In this study, bottlenose dolphin peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and adult female B6C3F1 mouse splenocytes were exposed to environmentally relevant PFOS concentrations (0-5 µg ml(-1)) in vitro; and natural killer (NK) cell activity and lymphocyte proliferation (T and B cell) were assessed using the parallelogram approach for risk assessment. The objectives were: to corroborate results from the correlative studies in bottlenose dolphins with in vitro PFOS exposures; to evaluate the sensitivity of the mouse model as compared with bottlenose dolphins; and to assess risk using the parallelogram approach. In mouse cells, NK cell activity was decreased at in vitro doses of 0.01, 0.5, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 µg PFOS ml(-1) and increased at 5 µg ml(-1). Additionally, B cell proliferation was not altered, but T cell proliferation was decreased at all in vitro PFOS exposures. In dolphin cells, NK cell activity and T cell proliferation were not altered by in vitro PFOS exposure, but B cell proliferation exhibited a positive association in relation to PFOS dose. Overall, the data indicates that: the in vitro exposures of bottlenose dolphin PBLs exhibited results similar to reported correlative fields studies; that mice were generally more sensitive (for these selected endpoints) than were dolphins; and that the parallelogram approach could be used two-thirds of the time to predict the effects in bottlenose dolphins.
Occurrence and potential combined toxicity of dissolved organic contaminants in the Forth estuary and Firth of Forth, Scotland assessed using passive samplers and an algal toxicity test.	As an alternative procedure to conventional water quality assessment, the presence and combined toxicity of dissolved organic contaminants in water at five sites in the Forth estuary and the Firth of Forth, Scotland, United Kingdom was investigated using silicone rubber passive sampling devices (SR-PSDs) and an algal growth inhibition bioassay. SR-PSDs were deployed in water at the five sites for ~2 months. Following retrieval, extracts from the deployed SR-PSDs were assessed for both algal growth inhibition and the occurrence of a wide range of organic contaminants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and a variety of plant protection products (PPPs; commonly referred to collectively as 'pesticides'). The 72 h algal growth inhibition test was performed using a native marine phytoplankton (Diacronema lutheri) in 24 well microplates. Freely dissolved (e.g. bioavailable) concentrations of PAHs and PCBs were determined using performance reference compounds (PRCs). The algal toxicity tests exhibited varied effects at the five sites indicating the presence of, and exposure to, phytotoxic compounds and their potential toxicity in the Forth. The individual and total dissolved concentrations of 40 PAHs and 32 PCBs measured in the study were relatively low and showed input of petrogenic, atmospheric and sewage related sources. Several pesticides of diverse polarities were identified in the water suggesting sources from both riverine input and direct discharges. The study thus illustrates the value of combining bioassays and chemical analysis (with effective sampling technique) for a realistic and rapid assessment of organic contaminants in the aquatic environment.
Pathology of lethal and sublethal doses of aerosolized ricin in rhesus macaques.	Ricin toxin, a type 2 ribosome-inactivating protein and a category B bioterrorism agent, is produced from the seeds of castor oil plant (Ricinus communis). Chronic pathological changes in survivors of aerosolized ricin exposure have not been reported in primates. Here we compare and contrast the pathological changes manifested between rhesus macaques (RM) that succumbed to lethal dose of ricin (group I) and survivor RM exposed to low dose of ricin (group II). All animals in group I exhibited severe diffuse, necrotizing bronchiolitis and alveolitis with fibrinopurulent bronchointerstitial pneumonia, massive alveolar, perivascular and peribronchial/bronchiolar edema with hemorrhage, and necropurulent and hemorrhagic tracheobronchial lymphadenitis. All animals from group II had multifocal, fibrosing interstitial pneumonia with prominent alveolar histiocytosis and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. Subacute changes like infiltration by lymphocytes and plasma cells and persistence of edematous fluid were occasionally present in lung and tracheobronchial lymph nodes. The changes appear to be a continuum wherein the inflammatory response shifts from an acute to subacute/chronic reparative process if the animals can survive the initial insult. 
Metabolism and toxicity studies supporting the safety of rebaudioside D.	Rebaudioside D (Reb D) is one of the several glycosides found in the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni) Bertoni (Compositae) which has been identified as a potential sweetener. The metabolism of Reb A and Reb D was evaluated in various in vitro matrices (simulated gastrointestinal fluids, rat liver microsomes, and rat cecal contents) and through analysis of plasma collected from rats in a dietary toxicity study. Reb A and Reb D showed similar stability when exposed to simulated stomach and small intestine fluids, with susceptibility to hydrolytic degradation by enteric bacteria collected from the cecum. Incubations with rat liver microsomes indicated that neither compound is expected to be metabolized by the liver enzymes. Plasma concentrations of Reb D, Reb A, and/or the final hydrolysis product of each compound, free/conjugated steviol, were consistent between animals administered either Reb D or Reb A in the diet. A repeated exposure dietary toxicity study was conducted to compare the safety of Reb D, when administered at target exposure levels of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg body weight (bw)/d to Sprague-Dawley rats for 28 days, to that of Reb A administered at a target exposure level of 2000 mg/kg bw/d. There were no treatment-related effects on the general condition and behavior of the animals and no toxicologically relevant, treatment-related effects on hematology, serum chemistry, or urinalysis. Macroscopic and microscopic findings revealed no treatment-related effects on any organ evaluated. Results were comparable between the group administered 2000 mg/kg/d Reb D and the group administered 2000 mg/kg/d Reb A. 
Disinfection by-products and ecotoxicity of ballast water after oxidative treatment--results and experiences from seven years of full-scale testing of ballast water management systems.	Since 2005, five different ballast water management systems (BWMSs) based on chlorination treatment have been tested by Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) according to guidelines from the International Maritime Organization (IMO). 25% and >50% of all the tested discharge samples exhibited acute and chronic toxic effects on algae, respectively. In most cases this toxicity was plausibly caused by a high free residual oxidant (FRO) level (>0.08 mg Cl/l). Of the 22 disinfection by-products (DBPs) that were identified in treated water at discharge, four compounds were at times found at concentrations that may pose a risk to the local aquatic environment. However, there seemed to be no clear indication that the measured DBP concentrations contributed to the observed algal toxicity. The addition of methylcellulose instead of lignin in the test water to comply with IMO requirements seemed to limit the formation of DBP.
Toxicogenomics-based identification of mechanisms for direct immunotoxicity.	Compounds with direct immunotoxic properties, including metals, mycotoxins, agricultural pesticides, and industrial chemicals, form potential human health risks due to exposure through food, drinking water, and the environment. Insights into the mechanisms of action are currently lacking for the majority of these direct immunotoxicants. Therefore, the present work aimed to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying direct immunotoxicity. To this end, we assessed in vitro the effects of 31 test compounds on the transcriptome of the human Jurkat T-cell line. These compounds included direct immunotoxicants, immunosuppressive drugs with different mode of actions, and nonimmunotoxic control chemicals. Pathway analysis of the microarray data allowed us to identify canonical pathways and Gene Ontology processes that were transcriptionally regulated in common by immunotoxicants (1) with structural similarities, such as tributyltin chloride and tributyltin oxide that activated the retinoic acid/X receptor signaling pathway and (2) without structural similarities, such as As2O3, dibutyltin chloride, diazinon, MeHg, ochratoxin A (OTA), S9-treated OTA, S9-treated cyclophosphamide, and S9-treated benzo[a]pyrene, which activated unfolded protein response, and FTY720, lindane, and propanil, which activated the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. In addition, processes uniquely affected by individual immunotoxicants were identified, such as the induction of Notch receptor signaling and the downregulation of acute-phase response genes by OTA. These findings were validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of genes involved in these processes. Our study indicated that diverse modes of action are involved in direct immunotoxicity and that a set of pathways or genes, rather than one single gene, can be used to screen compounds for direct immunotoxicity. 
Prolonged overdose of all-trans retinoic acid enhances bone sensitivity in castrated mice.	Intake of multivitamin preparations is very common in developed countries. However, excessive intake of vitamin A was associated with increased bone fragility. The aim of this study was to determine if chronic administration of the active metabolite of vitamin A all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in slight excess is associated with changes of bone turnover and density in intact and castrated mice.
Defensive bacteriome symbiont with a drastically reduced genome.	Diverse insect species harbor symbiotic bacteria, which play important roles such as provisioning nutrients and providing defense against natural enemies [1-6]. Whereas nutritional symbioses are often indispensable for both partners, defensive symbioses tend to be of a facultative nature [1-12]. The Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri is a notorious agricultural pest that transmits Liberibacter spp. (Alphaproteobacteria), causing the devastating citrus greening disease or Huanglongbing [13, 14]. In a symbiotic organ called the bacteriome, D. citri harbors two distinct intracellular symbionts: a putative nutrition provider, Carsonella_DC (Gammaproteobacteria), and an unnamed betaproteobacterium with unknown function [15], for which we propose the name "Candidatus Profftella armatura." Here we report that Profftella is a defensive symbiont presumably of an obligate nature with an extremely streamlined genome. The genomes of Profftella and Carsonella_DC were drastically reduced to 464,857 bp and 174,014 bp, respectively, suggesting their ancient and mutually indispensible association with the host. Strikingly, 15% of the small Profftella genome encoded horizontally acquired genes for synthesizing a novel polyketide toxin. The toxin was extracted, pharmacologically and structurally characterized, and designated diaphorin. The presence of Profftella and its diaphorin-biosynthetic genes was perfectly conserved in the world's D. citri populations. 
Derivation of South African water quality guidelines for Roundup(®) using species sensitivity distribution.	Glyphosate-based herbicides are among the leading products used in South Africa to control weeds and invading alien plant species. Although these herbicides ultimately find their way into aquatic ecosystems, South Africa has no water quality guideline based on indigenous species to protect the country's aquatic biota against these biocides. In this study, South African water quality guidelines (SAWQGs) for Roundup(®) based on species sensitivity distribution (SSD) using indigenous aquatic biota were developed. Short-term and long-term toxicity tests were conducted with eight different aquatic species belonging to five different taxonomic groups. Static non-renewal experimental methods were employed for short-term lethal tests (≤4 days), and static renewal for long-term sublethal tests (≥4 days ≤21 days). LC50 values for animal exposure and EC50 values for algae were calculated using probit analysis and linear regression of transformed herbicide concentration as natural logarithm data against percentage growth inhibition, respectively. No effect concentration (NEC) was determined based on the dynamic energy budget model, using survival data. The LC50, EC50 and NEC values were used to develop species sensitivity distribution (SSD) concentrations for Roundup(®). Based on the SSD concentrations, the short-term and long-term SAWQGs for Roundup(®) were derived as 0.250 (0.106-0.589) mg/L, and 0.002 (0.000-0.021) mg/L, respectively. These WQGs may be useful in protecting South African aquatic life against transient or long-term exposure to glyphosate-based chemicals as part of integrated water resources management. 
The evolution of juvenile animal testing for small and large molecules.	Recent formalised regulatory requirements for ensuring safe use of new drugs in children has increased the requirement, when considered relevant, to perform juvenile animal testing before commencing paediatric clinical trials. A key goal of this work is to identify or examine for a developmental or toxicity finding not seen in other toxicology testing. With our current knowledge, this paper examines what types of testing are occurring, what novel findings are being seen and their relevance in the safety evaluation process. Furthermore, trends for now and the future in the type of juvenile animal testing will be described including a need for more focused study designs and more published data on modern cross-species postnatal development.
3, 4- dinitro-furazan-based oxidation furazan acute and subchronic toxicity studies]	To study the 3, 4- dinitro-furazan-based oxidation furazan (DNTF) of sub-acute toxicity and chronic toxicity, to determine the acute toxicity classification DNTF, the nature of toxic effects and major target organ for the development provide the basis for occupational exposure limits.
Effect of the extracts of the spiderflower, Cleome arabica, on feeding and survival of larvae of the cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis.	Aqueous and organic (hexane, chloroform, and methanol) extracts of siliquae, stems and leaves, and seeds of Cleome arabica L. (Brassicales: Capparidaceae) were evaluated in the laboratory for their antifeeding and insecticidal effect on larvae of the cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval) (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), using a leaf dipping bioassay with castor bean, Ricinus communis L. (Malpighiales: Euphorbiaceae), leaf discs. The polar extracts caused significant mortality. At the highest dose, C. arabica extracts exhibited significant antifeeding and phagostimulating activities against S. littoralis larvae. Under no-choice conditions, the methanol extract of siliquae was the most active, and the antifeedant index calculated over 24 hr for 3rd instar larvae varied significantly from 16 to 37%. Using nutritional indices, it was established that there was a significant decrease in growth rate concomitant with a reduction in consumption. These results suggest the presence of anti-feeding and/or toxic substances in the extracts that may be useful in developing bio-insecticides based on C. arabica extracts for use in integrated pest management of leafworm and other agricultural pests.
Drug delivery systems using sandwich configurations of electrospun poly(lactic acid) nanofiber membranes and ibuprofen.	The primary advantages of electrospun membranes include the ability to obtain very thin fibers that are on the order of magnitude of several nanometers with a considerable superficial area and the possibility for these membranes to be manipulated and processed for many different applications. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and quantify the transport mechanisms that control the release of drugs from polymer-based sandwich membranes produced using the electrospinning processes. These electrospun membranes were composed of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) because it is one of the most promising biodegradable polymers due to its mechanical properties, thermoplastic processability and biological properties, such as its biocompatibility and biodegradability. The transport mechanism that controls the drug delivery was evaluated via the release kinetics of a bioactive agent in physiological serum, which was used as a corporal fluid simulation. To describe the delivery process, mathematical models, such as the Power Law, the classical Higuchi equation and an approach to Fick's Second Law were used. Using the applied mathematical models, it is possible to conclude that control over the release of the drug is significantly dependent on the thickness of the membrane rather than the concentration of the drug. 
Enhanced cytotoxicity of pentachlorophenol by perfluorooctane sulfonate or perfluorooctanoic acid in HepG2 cells.	Chlorinated phenols and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are two kinds of pollutants which are widely present in the environment. Considering liver is the primary toxic target organ for these two groups of chemicals, it is interesting to evaluate the possible joint effects of them on liver. In this work, the combined toxicity of pentachlorophenol (PCP) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were investigated using HepG2 cells. The results indicated that PFOS and PFOA could strengthen PCP's hepatotoxicity. Further studies showed that rather than intensify the oxidative stress or promote the biotransformation of PCP, PFOS (or PFOA) might lead to strengthening of the oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling of PCP. By measuring the intracellular PCP concentration and the cell membrane properties, it was suggested that PFOS and PFOA could disrupt the plasma membrane and increase the membrane permeability. Thus, more cellular accessibility of PCP was induced when they were co-exposed to PCP and PFOS (or PFOA), leading to increased cytotoxicity. Further research is warranted to better understand the combined toxicity of PFAAs and other environmental pollutants. 
Toxicity assessment of the maize herbicides S-metolachlor, benoxacor, mesotrione and nicosulfuron, and their corresponding commercial formulations, alone and in mixtures, using the Microtox(®) test.	The Microtox(®) test, using the prokaryote Vibrio fischeri, was employed to assess the toxicity of the maize herbicides S-metolachlor, benoxacor, mesotrione and nicosulfuron, and their formulated compounds: Dual Gold Safeneur(®), Callisto(®) and Milagro(®); alone and in mixtures. For each compound we obtained original IC50 values, with consistent higher toxicities for formulated compounds compared to active ingredients alone. Mixtures of the four herbicides, prepared according to application doses encountered in agriculture, were found to be toxic at a lower concentration than single molecules. Mesotrione and nicosulfuron mixture appeared to be highly toxic to V. fischeri, however, this recommended post-emergence combination for maize crops got its toxicity decreased in formulated compound mixtures, suggesting that chemical interactions could potentially reduce the toxicity. Data comparisons to theoretical models showed a good prediction of mixture toxicity by Concentration Addition concept. Results seemed to exclude any synergistic effects on V. fischeri for the tested herbicide mixtures. Additional work coupling these bioassay data to ecosystemic level studies (aquatic and soil compartments) and data on additives and degradation products toxicity, will help to fill the gap in our knowledge of the environmental impact of these xenobiotics and in the choice of a more sustainable use of pesticides.
Detoxifying CO2 capture reclaimer waste by anaerobic digestion.	The decrease in toxicity of carbon capture reclaimer monoethanolamine (MEA) waste (MEAw) during anaerobic degradation of such waste together with easily degradable organics was investigated. Samples were collected from a bioreactor at steady state with 86 % organic chemical oxygen demand removal at room temperature, which had been running on MEAw for 2 years. The toxicity of the digester effluents were 126, 42 and 10 times lower than that of the MEAw to the tested freshwater trophic groups of Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Daphnia magna and embryos of Danio rerio, respectively. The toxicity of the tested taxonomic groups after anaerobic digestion was mainly attributed to the ammonia generated by the degradation of MEAw.
Effects of chronic exposure of methomyl on the antioxidant system in kidney of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and recovery pattern.	Tilapia were exposed to sublethal methomyl concentrations of 0, 0.2, 2, 20, or 200 μg/L for 30 d, and then were transferred to methomyl-free water for 18 d. Renal antioxidant parameters, including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) , glutathione reductase (GR), total glutathione (GSH), and reduced glutathione (GSSG), were examined in tilapia at d 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 after starting the experiment and at 18 d after transferring to methomyl-free water. There were no significant changes in enzymatic activity and content of antioxidants in kidney of tilapia exposed to 0.2 μg/L methomyl compared to controls. The results showed significant increases in SOD, CAT, GST, GR, GPx, and level of GSSG accompanied by a decrease in GSH levels following methomyl exposure in tilapia to 2, 20, or 200 μg/L over the 30-d exposure period, suggesting the presence of oxidative stress. Thus, it would appear the 0.2 μg/L methomyl might be considered the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL). Recovery data showed that the effects produced by lower concentration of methomyl at 20 μg/L were reversible but not at the higher 200 μg/L concentration. 
Cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of metal(oid)s bioactivated in rocket leaves (Eruca vesicaria subsp. sativa Miller).	Rocket is an important source of essential elements. However, it may also accumulate toxic elements such as metal(oids). The objectives of the present work were (i) to study the uptake of arsenic, lead, cadmium and zinc in rocket grown in contaminated soils, (ii) to establish the genotoxic and cytotoxic activities of this vegetable material, and (iii) to study the modulator role of the glucosinolate and metal contents in the genotoxic/cytotoxic activities. Lead, cadmium and zinc leaf concentrations in our study were over the concentrations allowed by the statutory limit set for metal(oid) contents in vegetables. The accessions were non genotoxic at the different concentrations studied, although one of the accessions showed the highest mutation rates doubling those of negative control. The cytotoxicity assays with HL60 human leukaemia cells showed that the tumouricide activities of rocket leaves decreased with the increasing of metal(oid) concentrations and also with the decreasing of glucosinolate concentrations in their tissues. An interaction between metal(oid)s and glucosinolate degradation products contained in rocket leaves is suggested as the main modulator agents of the biological activity of the plants grown in metal-contaminated soils. 
Deleterious effects of mycotoxin combinations involving ochratoxin A.	Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a nephrotoxic mycotoxin with carcinogenic properties. Its presence was detected in various foodstuffs all over the world but with significantly higher frequency and concentrations in areas with endemic nephropathy (EN). Even though food is often contaminated with more than one mycotoxin, earlier studies focused on the occurrence and toxicology of only OTA. Only a limited number of surveys showed that OTA co-occurs in food with mycotoxins (citrinin-CIT, penicilic acid, fumonisin B1-FB1, aflatoxins-AF) which exert nephrotoxic, carcinogenic or carcinogen-promoting activity. This review summarises the findings on OTA and its co-occurrence with the mentioned mycotoxins in food as well as experimental data on their combined toxicity. Most of the tested mycotoxin mixtures involving OTA produced additive or synergistic effects in experimental models suggesting that these combinations represent a significant health hazard. Special attention should be given to mixtures that include carcinogenic and cancer-promoting mycotoxins. 
Single oral dose toxicity test of polycalcium, a mixed composition of polycan and calcium lactate-gluconate 1:9 (G/G) in SD rat.	The object of this study was to obtain acute oral toxicity information of Polycalcium, a mixed composition of Polycan and Calcium lactate-gluconate 1:9 (g/g), in Sprague-Dawely (SD) rats. In order to investigate the toxicity and identify target organs, Polycalcium were once orally administered to female and male SD rats at dose levels of 2000, 1000, 500 and 0 (control) mg/kg body weights. The mortality, changes on body weight and clinical signs were monitored during 14 days after treatment with gross observation, changes on the organ weights and histopathology of principle organs and treatment sites based on the recommendation of KFDA Guidelines [2009-116, 2009]. As the results of single oral treatment of Polycalcium, no treatment related mortalities were observed within 14 days after end of treatment up to 2000 mg/kg, the limited dosage of rodents in the both genders. In addition, no Polycalcium treatment related changes on the body and organ weights, clinical signs, necropsy and histopathological findings were detected. The results obtained in this study suggest that the Polycalcium is non-toxic in rats. The LD50 and approximate LD in rats after single oral dose of Polycalcium were considered over 2000 mg/kg in both female and male, respectively. 
Toxicity of nonylphenol diethoxylate in lab-scale anaerobic digesters.	Nonylphenol compounds have high commercial, industrial and domestic uses owing to their surface active properties. In addition to their toxic, carcinogenic and persistent characteristics; they have drawn the attention of scientists lately due to their endocrine disrupting properties. Their widespread use and disposal cause them to enter wastewater treatment systems at high concentrations. Since they are highly persistent and hydrophobic, they accumulate mostly on sludge. In this study using Anaerobic Toxicity Assay (ATA) tests, the toxicity of a model nonylphenol compound, nonylphenol diethoxylate (NP2EO), for anaerobic digestion of sludge was determined. The test bottles were dosed with NP2EO in acetone, with concentrations ranging from 1 mg L(-1) to 30 mg L(-1). During the tests, gas productions and compositions in terms of methane and carbon dioxide were monitored. To be able to judge about the fate, the target compounds were extracted from water and sludge and analyzed using GC/MS. The sludge samples used for assembling the reactors were found to contain NP and NP1EO but no NP2EO. After the assay was completed, all the NP2EO spiked into the live reactors was found to disappear. The increase seen in NP1EO and NP and further accumulation of NP in the system, indicated the conversion of NP2EO to these metabolites. On the other hand, no conversion was observed in abiotic reactors. Inhibition of NP2EO for anaerobic microorganisms was not observed throughout the tests considering the biogas production of the test reactors in comparison to the control reactors.
The toxicological application of transcriptomics and epigenomics in zebrafish and other teleosts.	Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is one of a number of teleost fish species frequently employed in toxicology. Toxico-genomics determines global transcriptomic responses to chemical exposures and can predict their effects. It has been applied successfully within aquatic toxicology to assist in chemical testing, determination of mechanisms and environmental monitoring. Moreover, the related field of toxico-epigenomics, that determines chemical-induced changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications and micro-RNA expression, is emerging as a valuable contribution to understanding mechanisms of both adaptive and adverse responses. Zebrafish has proven a useful and convenient model species for both transcriptomic and epigenetic toxicological studies. Despite zebrafish's dominance in other areas of fish biology, alternative fish species are used extensively in toxico-genomics. The main reason for this is that environmental monitoring generally focuses on species native to the region of interest. We are starting to see advances in the integration of high-throughput screening, omics techniques and bioinformatics together with more traditional indicator endpoints that are relevant to regulators. Integration of such approaches with high-throughput testing of zebrafish embryos, leading to the discovery of adverse outcome pathways, promises to make a major contribution to ensuring the safety of chemicals in the environment.
A new approach to radial basis function approximation and its application to QSAR.	We describe a novel approach to RBF approximation, which combines two new elements: (1) linear radial basis functions and (2) weighting the model by each descriptor's contribution. Linear radial basis functions allow one to achieve more accurate predictions for diverse data sets. Taking into account the contribution of each descriptor produces more accurate similarity values used for model development. The method was validated on 14 public data sets comprising nine physicochemical properties and five toxicity endpoints. We also compared the new method with five different QSAR methods implemented in the EPA T.E.S.T. program. Our approach, implemented in the program GUSAR, showed a reasonable accuracy of prediction and high coverage for all external test sets, providing more accurate prediction results than the comparison methods and even the consensus of these methods. Using our new method, we have created models for physicochemical and toxicity endpoints, which we have made freely available in the form of an online service at http://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/apps/cap.
Fungal and enzymatic treatment of mature municipal landfill leachate.	The aim of our study was to evaluate biotreatability of mature municipal landfill leachate by using white rot fungus and its extracellular enzymes. Leachates were collected in one active and one closed regional municipal landfill. Both chosen landfills were operating for many years and the leachates generated there were polluted by organic and inorganic compounds. The white rot fungus Dichomitus squalens was able to grow in the mature leachate from the closed landfill and as it utilizes present organic matter as a source of carbon, the results were showing 60% of DOC and COD removal and decreased toxicity to the bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri. On the other hand, growth of the fungus was inhibited in the presence of the leachate from the active landfill. However, when the leachate was introduced to a crude enzyme filtrate containing extracellular ligninolytic enzymes, removal levels of COD and DOC reached 61% and 44%, respectively. Furthermore, the treatment led to detoxification of the leachate to the bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri and to reduction of toxicity (42%) to the plant Sinapis alba. Fungal and enzymatic treatment seems to be a promising biological approach for treatment of mature landfill leachates and their application should be further investigated. 
Assessment of Jatropha curcas L. biodiesel seed cake toxicity using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo toxicity (ZFET) test.	Consequent to the growing demand for alternative sources of energy, the seeds from Jatropha curcas remain to be the favorite for biodiesel production. However, a significant volume of the residual organic mass (seed cake) is produced during the extraction process, which raises concerns on safe waste disposal. In the present study, we assessed the toxicity of J. curcas seed cake using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryotoxicity test. Within 1-h post-fertilization (hpf), the fertilized eggs were exposed to five mass concentrations of J. curcas seed cake and were followed through 24, 48, and 72 hpf. Toxicity was evaluated based on lethal endpoints induced on zebrafish embryos namely egg coagulation, non-formation of somites, and non-detachment of tail. The lowest concentration tested, 1 g/L, was not able to elicit toxicity on embryos whereas 100 % mortality (based also on lethal endpoints) was recorded at the highest concentration at 2.15 g/L. The computed LC50 for the J. curcas seed cake was 1.61 g/L. No further increase in mortality was observed in the succeeding time points (48 and 72 hpf) indicating that J. curcas seed cake exerted acute toxicity on zebrafish embryos. Sublethal endpoints (yolk sac and pericardial edema) were noted at 72 hpf in zebrafish embryos exposed to higher concentrations. The observed lethal endpoints induced on zebrafish embryos were discussed in relation to the active principles, notably, phorbol esters that have remained in the seed cake even after extraction. 
Impact of dredged urban river sediment on a Saronikos Gulf dumping site (Eastern Mediterranean): sediment toxicity, contaminant levels, and biomarkers in caged mussels.	Impacts of chemical contaminants associated with dumping of dredged urban river sediments at a coastal disposal area in Saronikos Gulf (Eastern Mediterranean) were investigated through a combined approach of sediment toxicity testing and active biomonitoring with caged mussels. Chemical analyses of aliphatic hydrocarbons (AHs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), Cu, and Zn in combination with the solid phase Microtox® test were performed on sediments. Concentrations of PAHs, AHs, Cu, and Zn as well as multiple biomarkers of contaminant exposure and/or effects were measured in caged mussels. Sediments in the disposal and neighboring area showed elevated PAHs and AHs concentrations and were characterized as toxic by the solid-phase Microtox® test during and after dumping operations. Biomarker results in the caged mussels indicated sublethal effects mainly during dumping operations, concomitantly with high concentrations of PAHs and AHs in the caged mussel tissues. Cu and Zn concentrations in sediments and caged mussels were generally not elevated except for sediments at the site in the disposal area that received the major amount of dredges. High PAHs and AHs levels as well as sublethal effects in the caged mussels were not persistent after termination of operations. The combined bioassay-biomarker approach proved useful for detecting toxicological impacts of dredged river sediment disposal in sediments and the water column. Nevertheless, further research is needed to evaluate whether sediment toxicity will have long-term effects on benthic communities of the disposal area. 
Endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by zinc oxide nanoparticles is an earlier biomarker for nanotoxicological evaluation.	Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) have been widely used in cosmetics and sunscreens, advanced textiles, self-charging and electronic devices; the potential for human exposure and the health impact at each stage of their manufacture and use are attracting great concerns. In addition to pulmonary damage, nanoparticle exposure is also strongly correlated with the increase in incidences of cardiovascular diseases; however, their toxic potential remains largely unclear. Herein, we investigated the cellular responses and endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress induced by ZnO NPs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in comparison with the Zn2+ ions and CeO2 NPs. We found that the dissolved zinc ion was the most significant factor for cytotoxicity in HUVECs. More importantly, ZnO NPs at noncytotoxic concentration, but not CeO2 NPs, can induce significant cellular ER stress response with higher expression of spliced xbp-1, chop, and caspase-12 at the mRNA level, and associated ER marker proteins including BiP, Chop, GADD34, p-PERK, p-eIF2α, and cleaved Caspase-12 at the protein levels. Moreover, ER stress was widely activated after treatment with ZnO NPs, while six of 84 marker genes significantly increased. ER stress response is a sensitive marker for checking the interruption of ER homeostasis by ZnO NPs. Furthermore, higher dosage of ZnO NPs (240 μM) quickly rendered ER stress response before inducing apoptosis. These results demonstrate that ZnO NPs activate ER stress-responsive pathway and the ER stress response might be used as an earlier and sensitive end point for nanotoxicological study.
Impact of agglomeration on the bioaccumulation of sub-100 nm sized TiO₂.	To improve our understanding on the impact of extrinsic properties of NPs on their bioaccumulation and toxicity, we have investigated the bioaccumulation of sub 100 nm sized P25 TiO₂ nanoparticles (NPs) by Daphnia magna (D. magna) in toxicity testing media. Based on our quantitative ICP-MS measurements as well as spectromicroscopic observations, we found that the bioaccumulation by D. magna were strongly influenced by the extrinsic properties of NPs as well as the biological uptake characteristics of D. magna. New sets of effective dosimetry parameters well correlated with the amount of NPs bioaccumulated within D. magna were also proposed. Based on these findings, we suggested that the extrinsic physicochemical properties of NPs (e.g., interfacial and colloidal properties of NPs) and biological characteristics for NPs (e.g., uptake cutoff sizes of testing organisms) should be considered and included when developing alternative dosimetry of NPs.
Fishing for teratogens: a consortium effort for a harmonized zebrafish developmental toxicology assay.	A consortium of biopharmaceutical companies previously developed an optimized Zebrafish developmental toxicity assay (ZEDTA) where chorionated embryos were exposed to non-proprietary test compounds from 5 to 6 h post fertilization and assessed for morphological integrity at 5 days post fertilization. With the original 20 test compounds, this achieved an overall predictive value for teratogenicity of 88% of mammalian in vivo outcome [Gustafson, A. L., Stedman, D. B., Ball, J., Hillegass, J. M., Flood, A., Zhang, C. X., Panzica-Kelly, J., Cao, J., Coburn, A., Enright, B. P., et al. (2012). Interlaboratory assessment of a harmonized Zebrafish developmental toxicology assay-Progress report on phase I. Reprod. Toxicol. 33, 155-164]. In the second phase of this project, 38 proprietary pharmaceutical compounds from four consortium members were evaluated in two laboratories using the optimized method using either pond-derived or cultivated-strain wild-type Zebrafish embryos at concentrations up to 100μM. Embryo uptake of all compounds was assessed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Twenty eight of 38 compounds had a confirmed embryo uptake of >5%, and with these compounds the ZEDTA achieved an overall predictive value of 82% and 65% at the two respective laboratories. When low-uptake compounds (≤ 5%) were retested with logarithmic concentrations up to 1000μM, the overall predictivity across all 38 compounds was 79% and 62% respectively, with the first laboratory achieving 74% sensitivity (teratogen detection) and 82% specificity (non-teratogen detection) and the second laboratory achieving 63% sensitivity (teratogen detection) and 62% specificity (non-teratogen detection). Subsequent data analyses showed that technical differences rather than strain differences were the primary contributor to interlaboratory differences in predictivity. Based on these results, the ZEDTA harmonized methodology is currently being used for compound assessment at lead optimization stage of development by 4/5 of the consortium companies. 
Response of microRNAs to in vitro treatment with graphene oxide.	Graphene oxide (GO) can be potentially used in biomedical and nonbiomedical products. The in vivo studies have demonstrated that GO is predominantly deposited in the lung. In the present study, we employed SOLiD sequencing technique to investigate the molecular control of in vitro GO toxicity in GLC-82 pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells by microRNAs (miRNAs), a large class of short noncoding RNAs acting to post-transcriptionally inhibit gene expression. In GLC-82 cells, GO exposure at concentrations more than 50 mg/L resulted in severe reduction in cell viability, induction of lactate dehydrogenase leakage, reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis, and dysregulation of cell cycle. GO was localized in cytosol, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus of cells. Based on SOLiD sequencing, we identified 628 up-regulated and 25 down-regulated miRNAs in GO-exposed GLC-82 cells. Expression of some selected dysregulated miRNAs was concentration-dependent in GO-exposed GLC-82 cells. The dysregulated miRNAs and their predicted targeted genes were involved in many biological processes. By combining both information on targeted genes for dysregulated miRNAs and known signaling pathways for apoptosis control, we hypothesize that the dysregulated miRNAs could activate both a death receptor pathway by influencing functions of tumor necrosis factor α receptor and caspase-3 and a mitochondrial pathway by affecting functions of p53 and Bcl-2 in GO-exposed GLC-82 cells. Our results provide an important molecular basis at the miRNA level for explaining in vitro GO toxicity. Our data will be also useful for developing new strategies to reduce GO toxicity such as surface chemical modification. 
Potential citric acid exposure and toxicity to Hawaiian hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus semotus) associated with Eleutherodactylus frog control.	We examined potential exposure of Hawaiian hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus semotus) to citric acid, a minimum risk pesticide registered for control of invasive Eleutherodactylus frog populations. Hoary bats are nocturnal insectivores that roost solitarily in foliage, federally listed as endangered, and are endemic to Hawaii. Oral ingestion during grooming of contaminated fur appears to be the principal route by which these bats might be exposed to citric acid. We made assessments of oral toxicity, citric acid consumption, retention of material on fur, and grooming using big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as a surrogate species. We evaluated both ground application and aerial application of 16 % solutions of citric acid during frog control operations. Absorbent bat effigies exposed to ground and aerial operational spray applications retained means of 1.54 and 0.02 g, respectively, of dry citric acid, although retention by the effigies was much higher than bat carcasses drenched in citric acid solutions. A high dose delivered orally (2,811 mg/kg) was toxic to the big brown bats and emesis occurred in 1 bat dosed as low as the 759 mg/kg level. No effect was observed with the lower doses examined (≤ 542 mg/kg). Bats sprayed with 5 ml of 16 % (w/w) citric acid solution showed no evidence of intoxication. In field situations, it is unlikely that bats would be sprayed directly or ingest much citric acid retained by fur. Based on our observations, we believe Hawaiian hoary bats to be at very low risk from harmful exposure to a toxic dose of citric acid during frog control operations.
Detoxifying of high strength textile effluent through chemical and bio-oxidation processes.	Small-scale textile industries (SSTIs) in India struggled for the economic and environmental race. A full-scale common treatment plant (CETP) working on the principle of destabilising negative charge colloidal particles and bio-oxidation of dissolved organic failed to comply with Inland Surface Waters (ISW) standards. Thus, presence of intense colour and organics with elevated temperature inhibited the process stability. Bench scale treatability studies were conducted on chemical and biological processes for its full-scale apps to detoxify a high strength textile process effluent. Colour, SS and COD removals from the optimised chemical process were 88%, 70% and 40%, respectively. Heterotrophic bacteria oxidised COD and BOD more than 84% and 90% at a loading rate 0.0108kgm(-3)d(-1) at 3h HRT. The combined chemical and bio-oxidation processes showed a great promise for detoxifying the toxic process effluent, and implemented in full-scale CETP. The post-assessment of the CETP resulted in detoxify the toxic effluent. 
Predicting criteria continuous concentrations of 34 metals or metalloids by use of quantitative ion character-activity relationships-species sensitivity distributions (QICAR-SSD) model.	Criteria continuous concentrations (CCCs) are useful for describing chronic exposure to pollutants and setting water quality standards to protect aquatic life. However, because of financial, practical, or ethical restrictions on toxicity testing, few data are available to derive CCCs. In this study, CCCs for 34 metals or metalloids were derived using quantitative ion character-activity relationships-species sensitivity distributions (QICAR-SSD) and the final acute-chronic ratio (FACR) method. The results showed that chronic toxic potencies were correlated with several physico-chemical properties among eight species chosen, where the softness index was the most predictive characteristic. Predicted CCCs for most of the metals, except for Lead and Iron, were within a range of 10-fold of values recommended by the U.S. EPA. The QICAR-SSD model was superior to the FACR method for prediction of data-poor metals. This would have significance for predicting toxic potencies and criteria thresholds of more metals or metalloids. 
Carbon nanotube-induced loss of multicellular chirality on micropatterned substrate is mediated by oxidative stress.	Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are receiving much attention in medicine, electronics, consumer products, and next-generation nanocomposites because of their unique nanoscale properties. However, little is known about the toxicity and oxidative stress related anomalies of CNTs on complex multicellular behavior. This includes cell chirality, a newly discovered cellular property important for embryonic morphogenesis and demonstrated by directional migration and biased alignment on micropatterned surfaces. In this study, we report the influence of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) on multicellular chirality. The incubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (hUVECs) and mouse myoblasts (C2C12) with CNTs at different doses and time points stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and intra- and extracellular oxidative stress (OS). The OS-mediated noxious microenvironment influences vital subcellular organelles (e.g., mitochondria and centrosomes), cytoskeletal elements (microtubules), and vinculin rich focal adhesions. The disorientated nuclear-centrosome (NC) axis and centriole disintegration lead to a decreased migration rate and loss of directional alignment on micropatterned surfaces. These findings suggest that CNT-mediated OS leads to loss of multicellular chirality. Furthermore, the in vitro microscale system presented here to measure cell chirality can be extended as a prototype for testing toxicity of other nanomaterials. 
Analytical approaches for quantification of a Nrf2 pathway activator: overcoming bioanalytical challenges to support a toxicity study.	Activation of the Nrf2 stress pathway is known to play an important role in the defense mechanism against electrophilic and oxidative damage to biological macromolecules (DNA, lipids, and proteins). Chemical inducers of Nrf2 such as sulforaphane, dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera®), CDDO-Me (bardoxolone-methyl), and 3-(dimethylamino)-4-((3-isothiocyanatopropyl)(methyl)amino)cyclobut-3-ene-1,2-dione (a synthetic sulforaphane analogue; will be referred to as ) have the ability to react with Keap1 cysteine residues, leading to activation of the Antioxidant Response Element (ARE). Due to their electrophilic nature and poor matrix stability, these compounds represent great challenges when developing bioanalytical methods to evaluate in vivo exposure. like SFN reacts rapidly with glutathione (GSH) and nucleophilic groups in proteins to form covalent adducts. In this work, three procedures were developed to estimate the exposure of in a non-GLP 7 day safety study in rats: (1) protein precipitation of blood samples with methanol containing the free thiol trapping reagent 4-fluoro-7-aminosulfonylbenzofurazan (ABD-F) to measure GSH- and N-acetylcysteine conjugated metabolites of ; (2) an Edman degradation procedure to cleave and analyze N-terminal adducts of at the valine moiety; and (3) treatment with ammonium hydroxide to measure circulating free- and all sulfhydryl bound . 
Application of toxicogenomic profiling to evaluate effects of benzene and formaldehyde: from yeast to human.	Genetic variation underlies a significant proportion of the individual variation in human susceptibility to toxicants. The primary current approaches to identify gene-environment (GxE) associations, genome-wide association studies and candidate gene association studies, require large exposed and control populations and an understanding of toxicity genes and pathways, respectively. This limits their application in the study of GxE associations for the leukemogens benzene and formaldehyde, whose toxicity has long been a focus of our research. As an alternative approach, our published work has applied innovative in vitro functional genomics testing systems, including unbiased functional screening assays in yeast and a near-haploid human bone marrow cell line. Through comparative genomic and computational analyses of the resulting data, human genes and pathways that may modulate susceptibility to benzene and formaldehyde were identified, and the roles of several genes in mammalian cell models were validated. In populations occupationally exposed to low levels of benzene, we applied peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcriptomics and chromosome-wide aneuploidy studies in lymphocytes. In this review, we describe our comprehensive toxicogenomic approach and the potential mechanisms of toxicity and susceptibility genes identified for benzene and formaldehyde, as well as related studies conducted by other researchers. 
Toxicological evaluation of 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol.	6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (6:2 FTOH; CF3[CF2]5[CH2]2OH, CAS# 647-42-7) was evaluated for acute, genetic, and subchronic toxicity using in vitro and in vivo methods. In rats, 6:2 FTOH was considered to be slightly toxic by the oral (LD50=1,750 mg/kg), and dermal (LD50 > 5,000 mg/kg) routes. In rabbits, 6:2 FTOH was not a primary skin or eye irritant, and it did not produce a dermal sensitization response in mice. In a 90-day subchronic study, 6:2 FTOH was administered to rats by oral gavage (0, 5, 25, 125, 250 mg/kg/day). Mortality was observed at 125 and 250 mg/kg/day; deaths occurred after approximately three weeks of dosing and continued sporadically. The NOAEL in the subchronic study was 5mg/kg/day based on hematology and liver effects. 6:2 FTOH was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation test or in the mouse lymphoma assay and was not clastogenic in a chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes. The hazard classification for human health endpoints of 6:2 FTOH according to the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) is Category 4 for acute oral toxicity based on an LD50 of 1,750 mg/kg. Other acute health endpoints including eye and skin irritation, skin sensitization, as well as genotoxicity, did not meet the criteria for hazard classification. Benchmark Dose Analysis was performed on the most sensitive endpoints from the 90-day oral gavage study and these levels were all above the study NOAEL of 5mg/kg/day. For risk assessment purposes, the recommended point of departure is the more conservative study NOAEL of 5mg/kg/day.
Caged mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray) as an integrated field biomonitoring tool: exposure assessment and reprotoxic effects of water column contamination.	This study highlights the usefulness of gastropods for water quality monitoring. Gastropods were caged upstream and downstream of an effluent discharge. Exposure was assessed by measurement of organic contaminants in water. Contamination of the Potamopyrgus antipodarum mudsnail was also measured using innovative techniques at the end of the 42 days of exposure. Biological effects were measured at the individual level (growth, reproduction) and subindividual level (energy reserves, vitellin-like proteins, steroid levels, expression of genes involved in estrogen signaling pathways), thus providing a better understanding of reprotoxic effects. The effluent was mainly contaminated by pharmaceutical compounds, as was the mudsnail. The highest concentrations were measured for oxazepam and were higher than 2 mg/kg downstream of the effluent discharge. Alkylphenols, bisphenol A, and vertebrate-like sex-steroid hormones were also bioaccumulated by the mudsnail downstream of the effluent. The combined use of water and snail contamination provided a complete exposure assessment. Exposure was further linked to biological effects. The mudsnail was shown to be a better adapted species for in situ exposures than Valvata piscinalis. Reproduction was sharply decreased after 6 weeks of exposure in the mudsnail. Feeding issues were excluded, confirming the toxic origin. These effects were related to estrogen signaling pathways using genomic analysis. Genes coding for proteins involved in nongenomic signaling pathways were inhibited, and those of genomic pathway repressors were induced. These results suggest that the chemical contamination due to the effluent discharge altered steroid control of reproduction and blocked the transition between oocyte and unshelled embryo, resulting in a drastic decrease of embryo production, while survival was not affected. 
Cytogenetics in benzene-associated myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia: new insights into a disease continuum.	Hematopoiesis in health and disease results from complex interactions between primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the extrinsic influences of other cells in the bone marrow (BM) niche. Advances in stem cell biology, molecular genetics, and computational biology reveal that the immortality, self-renewal, and maintenance of blood homeostasis generally attributed to individual HSCs are functions of the cells' behavior in the normal BM environment. Here we discuss how these advances, together with results of outcomes-based clinical epidemiology studies, provide new insight into the importance of epigenetic events in leukemogenesis. For the chemical benzene (Bz), development of myeloid neoplasms depends predominantly on alterations within the microenvironments in which they arise. The primary persistent disease in Bz myelotoxicity is myelodysplastic syndrome, which precedes cytogenetic injury. Evidence indicates that acute myeloid leukemia arises as a secondary event, subsequent to evolution of the leukemia-initiating cell phenotype within the altered BM microenvironment. Further explorations into the nature of chemical versus de novo disease should consider this mechanism, which is biologically distinct from previous models of clonal cytogenetic injury. Understanding alterations of homeostatic regulation in the BM niche is important for validation of models of leukemogenesis, monitoring at-risk populations, and development of novel treatment and prevention strategies. 
Derivation of an oral reference dose (RfD) for the nonphthalate alternative plasticizer 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, di-isononyl ester (DINCH).	1,2-Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, 1,2-diisononylester (DINCH), a polyvinyl chloride plasticizer, has food, beverage, and medical device applications that may result in general population exposure. Although no apparent toxicity information in humans was identified, there is a substantial data set in lab animals to serve as the basis of hazard identification for DINCH. Target tissues associated with repeated dietary DINCH exposure in lab animals included liver, kidney, and thyroid and mammary glands. In contrast to some phthalate ester plasticizers, DINCH did not show evidence of hepatic peroxisomal proliferation, testicular toxicity, or liver tumors in rats. Liver and thyroid effects associated with DINCH exposure were attributed to compensatory thyroid stimulation secondary to prolonged metabolic enzyme induction. The toxicological significance of mammary fibroadenomas in female rats is unclear, given that this common benign and spontaneously occurring tumor type is unique to rats. The weight of evidence suggests DINCH is not genotoxic and the proposed mode of action (MOA) for thyroid gland lesions was considered to have a threshold. No adverse reproductive effects were seen in a two-generation study. An oral reference dose (RfD) of 0.7 mg/kg-d was derived from a human equivalent BMDL₁₀ of 21 mg/kg-d for thyroid hypertrophy/hyperplasia seen in adult F₁ rats also exposed in utero. The total uncertainty factor of 30x was comprised of intraspecies (10×) and database (3×) factors. An interspecies extrapolation factor was not applied since rodents are more sensitive than humans with respect to the proposed indirect MOA for thyroid gland lesions.
Less is more: long-term in vitro exposure to low levels of silver nanoparticles provides new insights for nanomaterial evaluation.	In view of the vast number of new nanomaterials (NMs) that require testing and the constraints associated with animal models, the majority of studies to elucidate nanotoxicological effects have occurred in vitro, with limited correlation and applicability to in vivo systems and realistic, occupational exposure scenarios. In this study, we developed and implemented a chronic in vitro model coupled with lower, regulatory dosages in order to provide a more realistic assessment of NM-dependent consequences and illuminate the implications of long-term NM exposure. When keratinocytes were exposed to 50 nm silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs), we determined that chronically dosed cells operated under augmented stress and modified functionality in comparison to their acute counterparts. Specifically, Ag-NP exposure through a chronic mechanism increased p38 activation, actin disorganization, heightened ki67 expression, and extensive gene modification. Additionally, chronic Ag-NP exposure altered the way in which cells perceived and responded to epidermal growth factor stimulation, indicating a transformation of cell functionality. Most importantly, this study demonstrated that chronic exposure in the pg/mL range to Ag-NPs did not induce a cytotoxic response, but instead activated sustained stress and signaling responses, suggesting that cells are able to cope with prolonged, low levels of Ag-NP exposure. In summary, we demonstrated that through implementation of a chronic dosimetry paradigm, which more closely resembles realistic NM exposure scenarios, it is possible to illuminate long-term cellular consequences, which greatly differ from previously obtained acute assessments. 
Effects of male sexual maturity of reproductive endpoints relevant to DART studies in Wistar Hannover rats.	Wistar Hannover rats have been utilized as one of major strains in regulatory toxicology studies. This study was performed to verify the appropriate age of male sexual maturity in the development and reproductive toxicity (DART) study in Wistar Hannover rats (RccHan:WIST) by comparing reproductive endpoints between 8, 10 and 12 weeks of ages. Although fertility showed a tendency toward decrease in 8-week-old males, copulation index was not different among three ages. Testis weights reached a plateau at 10 weeks of age, whereas weights of other reproductive organs developed until 12 weeks of age. Indices of spermatogenesis (sperm motility, number of sperm in the epididymis and testis and contents of morphologically abnormal sperm) showed age-related progress and did not fully develop except for 12-week-old. For histology, epididymal tubules in 8-week-old animals showed immaturity with tall epithelium. At cesarean section, dams mated with 8-week-old males showed high incidence of preimplantation loss and the number of live fetuses was less than 10. In conclusion, although reproductive performance attained maturity by age of 10 weeks, spermatogenesis was not fully established at 10-week-old, which could result in a low fertility index. Therefore, we recommend that Wistar Hannover male rats at 12-week-old or older are used to conduct DART study properly and evaluate any adverse effects on dams and embryo-fetal development. 
Perturbation of physiological systems by nanoparticles.	Nanotechnology is having a tremendous impact on our society. However, societal concerns about human safety under nanoparticle exposure may derail the broad application of this promising technology. Nanoparticles may enter the human body via various routes, including respiratory pathways, the digestive tract, skin contact, intravenous injection, and implantation. After absorption, nanoparticles are carried to distal organs by the bloodstream and the lymphatic system. During this process, they interact with biological molecules and perturb physiological systems. Although some ingested or absorbed nanoparticles are eliminated, others remain in the body for a long time. The human body is composed of multiple systems that work together to maintain physiological homeostasis. The unexpected invasion of these systems by nanoparticles disturbs normal cell signaling, impairs cell and organ functions, and may even cause pathological disorders. This review examines the comprehensive health risks of exposure to nanoparticles by discussing how nanoparticles perturb various physiological systems as revealed by animal studies. The potential toxicity of nanoparticles to each physiological system and the implications of disrupting the balance among systems are emphasized. 
Human health risk assessment based on toxicity characteristic leaching procedure and simple bioaccessibility extraction test of toxic metals in urban street dust of Tianjin, China.	The potential ecological and human health risk related with urban street dust from urban areas of Tianjin, China was quantitatively analyzed using the method of toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and simple bioaccessibility extraction test (SBET). In the study, Hakason index, Nemerow index (P), the hazard index (HI) and the cancer risk index (RI) were calculated to assess the potential risk. The sequence of potential ecological risk based on Hakason index was arsenic (As) > cadmium (Cd) > lead (Pb) > copper (Cu) > chromium (Cr), in particular, As and Cd were regarded as high polluted metals. While the results of extraction of TCLP were assessed using P, the sequence was As > Pb > Cd > Cr > Cu, which mean that As and Pb should be low polluted, and Cd, Cr and Cu would barely not polluted. For human health, total carcinogenic risk for children and adults was 2.01 × 10(-3) and 1.05 × 10(-3), respectively. This could be considered to be intolerable in urban street dust exposure. The sequence in the hazard quotient (HQ) of each element was As > Cr > Pb > Cu > Cd. The HI value of these toxic metals in urban street dust for children and adults was 5.88 × 10(-1) and 2.80 × 10(-1), respectively. According to the characters of chemistry, mobility, and bioavailability of metals in urban street dust, we estimated the hazards on the environment and human health, which will help us to get more reasonable information for risk management of metals in urban environment.
Biodegradable polymeric system for cisplatin delivery: development, in vitro characterization and investigation of toxicity profile.	Cisplatin is one of the most potent anticancer agent used in the treatment of various solid tumors, however, its clinical use is limited due to severe adverse effects including nephrotoxicity. In this investigation cisplatin loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles were developed and characterized for various in vitro characteristics including size distribution, zeta potential, drug loading and release profile. PLGA nanoparticles were successfully developed as investigated using scanning electron microscopy and exhibited average particles size and zeta potential as 284.8 nm and -15.8 mV, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry indicated an absence of any polymer-drug interactions. Cisplatin nanoparticles exhibited in vitro anticancer activity against A549 cells comparable to that of cisplatin solution. The biodistribution study in mice indicated that the kidney cisplatin level was significantly (p<0.01) lower with cisplatin nanoparticles than cisplatin solution. Following two cycles of cisplatin treatment, a week apart, blood urea nitrogen level was found to be higher in case of cisplatin solution as compared to cisplatin nanoparticles. Further, there was a significant (p<0.01) increase in plasma creatinine level in case of cisplatin solution as compared to cisplatin nanoparticles. Histopathological examination of kidney from cisplatin nanoparticles treated group revealed no kidney damage, however, a sign of nephrotoxicity was observed in the case of cisplatin solution. The results suggest that PLGA nanoparticle based formulation could be a potential option for cisplatin delivery.
Toxicity assessment and modelling of Moringa oleifera seeds in water purification by whole cell bioreporter.	Moringa oleifera has been used as a coagulation reagent for drinking water purification, especially in developing countries such as Malawi. This research revealed the cytoxicity and genotoxicity of M. oleifera by Acinetobacter bioreporter. The results indicated that significant cytoxicity effects were observed when the powdered M. oleifera seeds concentration is from 1 to 50 mg/L. Through direct contact, ethanolic-water extraction and hexane extraction, the toxic effects of hydrophobic and hydrophilic components in M. oleifera seeds were distinguished. It suggested that the hydrophobic lipids contributed to the dominant cytoxicity, consequently resulting in the dominant genotoxicity in the water-soluble fraction due to limited dissolution when the M. oleifera seeds granule concentration was from 10 to 1000 mg/L. Based on cytoxicity and genotoxicity model, the LC50 and LC90 of M. oleifera seeds were 8.5 mg/L and 300 mg/L respectively and their genotoxicity was equivalent to 8.3 mg mitomycin C per 1.0 g dry M. oleifera seed. The toxicity of M. oleifera has also remarkable synergistic effects, suggesting whole cell bioreporter as an appropriate and complementary tool to chemical analysis for environmental toxicity assessment. 
Toxicity and chemical analyses of airport runoff waters in Poland.	The aim of this study was to assess the ecotoxicological effects of various compounds in complex airport effluents using a chemical and ecotoxicological integrated strategy. The present work deals with the determination of sum of PCBs, PAHs, pesticides, cations, anions, phenols, anionic, cationic, non-ionic detergents, formaldehyde and metals--as well as TOC and conductivity--in runoff water samples collected from 2009 to 2011 at several locations on two Polish international airports. Two microbiotests (Vibrio fischeri bacteria and the crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus) have been used to determine the ecotoxicity of airport runoff waters. The levels of many compounds exceeded several or even several tens of times the maximum permissible levels. Analysis of the obtained data shows that samples that displayed maximum toxicity towards the bioindicators Vibrio fischeri were not toxic towards Thamnocephalus platyurus. Levels of toxicity towards T. platyurus are strongly correlated with pollutants that originate from the technological operations related to the maintenance of airport infrastructure. The integrated (chemical-ecotoxicological) approach to environmental contamination assessment in and around airports yields extensive information on the quality of the environment. These methodologies can be then used as tools for tracking the environmental fate of these compounds and for assessing the environmental effect of airports. Subsequently, these data will provide a basis for airport infrastructure management.
Absence of irreversible effects of aliskiren in standard juvenile rat toxicity studies.	Aliskiren is the first orally bioavailable direct renin inhibitor approved for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Juvenile toxicity studies in rats were initiated to support treatment in the pediatric population.
Subchronic toxicological study of two artemisinin derivatives in dogs.	The objective of our study was to profile and compare the systematic changes between orally administered artesunate and intramuscularly injected artemether at a low dose over a 3-month period (92 consecutive days) in dogs. Intramuscular administration of 6 mg kg-1 artemether induced a decreased red blood cell (RBC) count (anemia), concurrent extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen and inhibition of erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. We also observed a prolonged QT interval and neuropathic changes in the central nervous system, which demonstrated the cortex and motor neuron vulnerability, but no behavioral changes. Following treatment with artesunate, we observed a decreased heart rate, which was most likely due to cardiac conduction system damage, as well as a deceased RBC count, extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen and inhibition of erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. However, in contrast to treatment with artemether, neurotoxicity was not observed following treatment with artesunate. In addition, ultra-structural examination by transmission electron microscopy showed mitochondrial damage following treatment with artesunate. These findings demonstrated the spectrum of toxic changes that result upon treatment with artesunate and artemether and show that the prolonged administration of low doses of these derivatives result in diverse toxicity profiles. 
A systematic review of occupational exposure to synthetic vitreous fibers and mesothelioma.	We investigated whether available epidemiological and toxicological data suggest an increased risk of mesothelioma among workers exposed to synthetic vitreous fibers (SVF).
Effects of mixture of pharmaceuticals on early life stages of tench (Tinca tinca).	Ubiquitous occurrence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environment results in concern about potential adverse the effects on nontarget organisms. In water, drugs are present in complex mixtures, in which complicated interactions affect toxicity of single components. The purpose of this study was to examine effect of 35-day-long exposure to mixture of ibuprofen, diclofenac, and carbamazepine on the mortality, growth, early ontogeny, and histopathological changes in tench (Tinca tinca). Early life stage toxicity test was carried out using a modified protocol according to OECD guideline 210. Exposure to mixture of pharmaceuticals at concentration of 60 μg · L(-1) for each substance was associated with significant increase in mortality, as well as significant increase in growth and elevated incidence of malformations. Any of the tested concentrations resulted in histopathological changes of liver, kidney, skin, or gill. After fourteen days of exposure there was short-term delay of development related to increased concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the mixture (2, 20, and 60 μg · L(-1)). Environmentally relevant concentrations (0.02; and 0.2 μg · L(-1)) used in this experiment did not result in toxic impairment of tench.
Evaluation of the antiviral activity of N-(phosphonoacetyl)-L-aspartate against paramyxoviruses in tissue culture and against respiratory syncytial virus in cotton rats.	N-(phosphonoacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), a potent inhibitor of L-aspartic acid transcarbamoylase, was evaluated for cytotoxicity and antiviral activity against three different paramyxoviruses in tissue culture, and for antiviral efficacy and toxicity in vivo using a cotton rat-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) model. Significant in vitro cytotoxicity was observed in proliferating cultures of HEp-2 (IC50 = 250 micrograms/ml) and Vero cells (IC50 = 32 micrograms/ml), but was less evident in cultures containing confluent monolayers (i.e., stationary cells) of these cells, or in cultures of Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (these IC50 values were all > or = 750 micrograms/ml, with 1000 micrograms/ml being the maximum concentration tested). Mean selective indices (ratio of the median cytotoxic dose: median efficacious dose) of 1, 72 and 146 were obtained against parainfluenza virus type 3, RSV and measles virus, respectively, when PALA was tested against these viruses using confluent HEp-2 and Vero cell monolayers. In cotton rats, significant reductions in pulmonary titers (0.8-1.4 log10/g lung) compared to pulmonary viral titers in placebo-treated control animals, were consistently seen in cotton rats given > or = 10 mg of PALA/kg/day (b.i.d.) intraperitoneally on days 1-3 postinfection with either subtype A or B RSV. No toxic effects were noted even in animals given 100 mg of PALA/kg/day for 7 consecutive days.
The effect of zinc on bacterial phagocytosis, killing and cytoprotection in human polymorphonuclear leucocytes.	An in vitro study examining the effects of zinc treatment on human PMN cell phagocytosis and killing of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and the cytoprotection of zinc against staphylococcal toxins. Phagocytosis was studied by transmission electron microscopy using different microbiological techniques, one of which was designed to follow the kinetics of bacterial killing. No effect was found on phagocytosis and bacterial killing. The cytotoxic effects of a crude toxin and an alpha-toxin extracted from Staphylococcus aureus preparations were studied on human PMN cells using the standard 51Cr release assay. Both toxins induced a dose-dependent leakage of 51Cr, indicating cell membrane damage. These results were confirmed by electron microscopy during the phagocytosis of S. aureus, where severe PMN cellular degeneration was observed. The addition of zinc to PMN cells strongly inhibited the release of 51Cr. In conclusion, our results show that zinc in higher than physiological concentrations does not inhibit PMN cell functions such as phagocytosis and intracellular killing of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. The addition of zinc may be beneficial in certain clinical situations, such as wound healing, zinc deficiency and infections involving toxin-producing bacteria, e.g. S. aureus.
Use of laboratory animals for toxicologic testing of drugs and chemicals]	For evaluation of the possible risk of drugs and chemicals for the human organism and its vital functions and to detect possible undesirable action on the environment, laboratory animals must be used. In toxicology as biomodels standard strains, as regards genetic and health aspects, mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs and dogs are used. The basis of standardization of conditions for keeping laboratory animals is as regards physical, chemical and biological aspects adherence to conditions of the adopted regulations of the Council of European Communities of Nov. 24, 1986. Council Directive 86/609/EEC, known in this country as the "Strasbourg convention". Part of the protection of laboratory animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes is also the adherence to the optimal number of animals as regards the area or cage where they are kept as well as the cubic measure of the space. Standardization of scientific results is promoted also by adherence to transport conditions of the animals, the time of acclimatization, quarantine. Knowledge of the basic biology of laboratory animals used should be obvious for experimental workers. All work on animals must be governed by valid laws and instructions which make work with animals possible. In the Czech Republic its is the act of the Czech National Council No. 246 issued in 1992 for the protection of animals from maltreatment according to which work with animals can be carried out only by institutions with accreditation for the given work which moreover have an ethical commission which issues permission for work with animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Safety evaluation of beta-glucanase derived from Trichoderma reesei: summary of toxicological data.	Barlican, a beta-glucanase enzyme obtained from Trichoderma reesei, was produced by a fermentation process and subjected to a series of toxicological tests to document its safety for use as a feed additive. The enzyme product was examined for general oral toxicity, inhalation toxicity, irritation to eye and skin, skin sensitization and mutagenic potential. An extensive literature search on the production organism was also conducted. Furthermore, safety for target species was assessed in a 28-day oral toxicity study with broilers. A strong skin-sensitizing potential of the beta-glucanase enzyme was detected, but no other evidence of oral or inhalation toxicity, mutagenic potential, eye or skin irritancy was found. Feeding of the beta-glucanase enzyme at dietary levels up to 10,000 ppm in the 90-day subchronic toxicity study in rats did not induce noticeable signs of toxicity. In addition, no adverse effects were observed when broiler chicks were fed dietary concentrations of the beta-glucanase enzyme up to eight times the daily recommended dose. It is therefore concluded that this beta-glucanase preparation is safe for use in feed of the intended target species. However, some occupational health precautions should be taken to avoid skin contact and inhalation, as is the case for almost all enzyme proteins.
Improving the diagnosis of hypersensitivity reactions associated with sulfonamides.	The differential diagnosis of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is difficult because symptoms are seldom pathognomonic. The authors compared the performance of two new diagnostic aids in the differential diagnosis of 27 cases of skin reactions associated with sulfonamide therapy. One test, the Bayesian Adverse Reaction Diagnostic Instrument (BARDI), calculates the posterior probability (PsP) of a drug being the etiology of an idiosyncratic ADR. The other, the lymphocyte toxicity assay (LTA), is a biochemical test that determines the percent of cell death because of toxic metabolites of a drug. Cases were assessed independently and blindly by BARDI and then the LTA. Skin reactions consisted of 19 exanthematous eruptions, 2 vasculitis, 1 erythema multiforme, and 5 urticarial rashes. BARDI indicated that the drug was very likely associated with 20 adverse events (PsP = 0.59 to 0.99); and unlikely to have caused 7 (PsP = 0.02 to 0.38). The LTA showed that 19 patients (70%) were test positive, and 8 were test negative. Comparing BARDI to LTA showed that BARDI had 79% sensitivity and 67% accuracy, but only 38% specificity. However, when the results of the LTA were incorporated into the calculation of the PsP based on this comparison, BARDI indicated that the drug was very likely associated with 18 reactions (PsP = 0.61 to 0.99) and unlikely to have caused 9 reactions (PsP = 0.003 to 0.47). The agreement increased from 67% to 96%. These findings indicate that the accuracy of diagnosis of idiosyncratic ADRs improved when the results of BARDI and LTA were combined. These findings also crossvalidate the results obtained by using BARDI.
High-dose interleukin-2 two days a week for metastatic renal cell carcinoma: a FNCLCC multicenter study.	The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of a new high-dose interleukin (IL)-2 regimen, given two days a week, for renal cell carcinoma. One hundred and four patients received IL-2 as a continuous i.v. infusion for 48 h at a daily dose of 24 x 10(6) IU/m2/day for 5 consecutive weeks. Patients were assessed for efficacy 4 and 8 weeks after the end of therapy, and patients who stabilized or responded received maintenance therapy with the same regimen. An objective clinical response was observed in 20 patients (complete in four, partial in 16). The dose of infused IL2 was significantly higher in the responders than in the nonresponders (p < 0.05). Clinical responses were significantly associated with a sedimentation rate of < 20 (p = 0.02), but no other prognostic factor was identified. Mean survival was 13 months. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were rare, except for hypotension (58% of patients), the main dose-limiting toxic effect. Overall, 83% of the planned dose of IL-2 was given. IL-2 given 2 days a week is active in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and well tolerated.
Characterization of exposure and dose of man made vitreous fiber in experimental studies.	The use of fibrous test materials in in vivo experiments introduces a number of significant problems not associated with nonfibrous particulates. The key to all aspects of the experiment is the accurate characterization of the test material in terms of fiber length, diameter, particulate content, and chemistry. All data related to fiber properties must be collected in a statistically sound manner to eliminate potential bias. Procedures similar to those outlined by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) or the World Health Organization (WHO) must be the basis of any fiber characterization. The test material to which the animal is exposed must be processed to maximize the amount of respirable fiber and to minimize particulate content. The complex relationship among the characteristics of the test material, the properties of the delivery system, and the actual dose that reaches the target tissue in the lung makes verification of dose essential. In the case of man-made vitreous fibers (MMVF), dose verification through recovery of fiber from exposed animals is a complex task. The potential for high fiber solubility makes many of the conventional techniques for tissue preservation and digestion inappropriate. Processes based on the minimum use of aggressive chemicals, such as cold storage and low temperature ashing, are potentially useful for a wide range of inorganic fibers. Any processes used to assess fiber exposure and dose must be carefully validated to establish that the chemical and physical characteristics of the fibers have not been changed and that the dose to the target tissue is completely and accurately described.
Role of biopersistence in the pathogenicity of man-made fibers and methods for evaluating biopersistence: a summary of two round-table discussions.	This paper summarizes two roundtable discussions held at the conclusion of the International Conference on Biopersistence of Respirable Synthetic Fibres and Minerals. The first round table addressed the role of biopersistence in the pathogenicity of fiber-induced disease. The panel included T. W. Hesterberg (Chairman), J.M.G. Davis, K. Donaldson, B. Fubini, N.F. Johnson, G. Oberdoerster, P. Sébastien, and D. Warheit. The second panel addressed the issue of methods for assessing biopersistence. It included R.O. McClellan (Chairman), J. Brain, A. Langer, A. Morgan, C. Morscheidt, H. Muhle, and R. Musselman. The two chairmen acknowledge the excellent contributions of all the members of the panels, whose comments formed the basis of this summary. Nonetheless, the authors assume full responsibility for the written text, recognizing that it was not reviewed by the discussants of the two panels.-Environ Health Perspect 102(Suppl 5):277-283 (1994)
Atypical tubule hyperplasia and renal tubule tumors in conventional rats on 90-day toxicity studies.	Bilateral, multicentric renal tubule tumors were found in 4 rats at the termination of 3 separate 90-day toxicity studies during the safety evaluation of 3 unrelated chemicals. The 3 studies were conducted at 2 separate locations, but the rats used were obtained from the same commercial source. The rat strains were Fischer-344 (1 male and 1 female case) and Sprague-Dawley (2 female cases). Three of the renal tumor cases were from either the high-dose or mid-dose treatment groups, and 1 case was an untreated control. The tumors were accompanied by multiple foci of atypical tubule hyperplasia but only in the tumor-bearing rats. There were no lesions associated with renal tumor pathogenesis in any of the remaining treated or untreated animals in the 3 studies. In addition, there was no indication of nephrotoxicity in the treated or untreated animals. Tumor morphology was characterized by a generally vacuolated appearance, eosinophilia, cytoplasmic and nuclear pleomorphism, and conspicuously hypertrophied nucleoli. The renal tubule tumors in these 90-day studies were compared to hereditary renal tubule tumors occurring in the Eker rat, a Long-Evans derivative with a genetic predisposition to this tumor type. The multiplicity of renal tubule tumors, early age of onset, and tumor morphology described in the cases from the 90-day studies were very similar to those characterizing the hereditary renal tumor model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of ozone and ozone 4-(N-nitrosomethylamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone in Fischer-344/N rats.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the toxicity and potential carcinogenicity or cocarcinogenicity of ozone exposure in rats. Fischer-344/N (F-344/N) rats were exposed 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk, to 0, 0.12, 0.5, or 1.0 ppm ozone by inhalation for 2-yr and lifetime exposures. The cocarcinogenicity study included subcutaneous administration of 0, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/kg body weight of 4-(N-nitrosomethylamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and inhalation of 0 or 0.5 ppm ozone to male rats. NNK was administered by subcutaneous injections 3 times per week for the first 20 wk with ozone inhalation exposure. The ozone inhalation exposure was for 2 yr (104 wk), including the first 20 wk of NNK treatment and continuing for 84 wk after the last NNK injection. Ozone exposure caused a concentration-related increase in inflammation of the centriacinar region of the lung. There was also increased fibrosis and an extension of the bronchiolar epithelium in these centriacinar regions to involve the proximal alveoli. There was no increased incidence of neoplasms at any site, including the lung, that was associated with ozone exposure. Rats administered 1.0 mg/kg body weight NNK alone had an increased incidence of bronchiolar/alveolar neoplasms, but this effect was not enhanced by ozone exposure. Ozone exposure for 2 yr and lifetime was associated with site-specific toxic alterations in the nasal passage and lung similar to those previously described for short-term exposures. While there was significant attenuation of the pulmonary lesions as compared to short-term exposures, lesions persisted in the lifetime study and there was evidence of a mild progressive fibrosis. We conclude that under the conditions of these studies: (a) ozone exposure is not carcinogenic to either male or female F-344/N rats, (b) ozone does not enhance the incidence of pulmonary neoplasms in F-344/N rats exposed to a known pulmonary carcinogen (NNK), and (c) mild site-specific toxic lesions characteristic of ozone exposure persist in the nasal passage and lung throughout the lifetime of the rat with continued ozone exposure.
General principles for safety evaluation of pharmaceuticals in man based on integration of data from various sources]	Safety evaluation of pharmaceuticals consists of two processes; firstly, to grade the adverse effects of a test material on individuals based on scientific evidence, and, secondly, to judge whether the adverse effects occurring under the dose condition of the material capable of exhibiting its efficacy in patients remains within the acceptable safe range. Accordingly, the basic criteria for safety evaluation of pharmaceuticals can be, simply, said to know how high the dose-response curve of adverse effects lies above that of efficacy. On the other hand, the judgement concerning how much difference is necessary between both dose-response curves with regard to the safety would require a careful consideration on a case by case basis taking into account various information on the risk/benefit balance of the drug such as 1) medical usefulness and social needs of the drug and 2) the presumed severity of adverse effects in man.
Association between alpha-hemolysin production and HeLa cell-detaching activity in fecal isolates of Escherichia coli.	Escherichia coli isolates that cause detachment of cell monolayers during in vitro adherence assays (cell-detaching E. coli [CDEC]) were recently reported as a potential new group of enteropathogenic bacteria. In the present study, 269 E. coli isolates from feces of children 1 to 5 years of age were identified as CDEC in a detaching assay developed with HeLa cells. The great majority of these isolates were hemolytic within 3 h of growth on blood agar plates and hybridized with a DNA probe for alpha-hemolysin (93.7%), while most of the non-detaching isolates were hemolytic within 24 h (3.6%) or nonhemolytic (94.8%). E. coli isolates that produced alpha-hemolysin were found in 60 (30%) of 200 children with diarrhea and 47 (24%) of 200 age-matched controls. No statistical significance was found for the differences in alpha-hemolysin production among the matched pairs (P = 0.2). These data suggest that CDEC isolates are not associated with diarrhea in the population studied.
Characterization of Vibrio cgolerae non-O1 serogroups obtained from an outbreak of diarrhea in Lima, Peru.	In February 1994, an outbreak of diarrhea caused by non-O1 Vibrio cholerae occurred among volunteers in a vaccine trial study area in Lima, Peru. Clinically, 95% of the patients presented with liquid diarrhea with either no or mild dehydration. Serogrouping of 58 isolates recovered from diarrheal patients affected in the outbreak revealed seven different serogroups, with serogroups O10 (21%) and O12 (65%) being predominant. Most of these isolates were susceptible to a variety of antimicrobial agents. None of the 58 isolates hybridized with a DNA probe previously used to detect the gene encoding the heat-stable enterotoxin NAG-ST or produced cholera toxin as assessed by GM1 ganglioside enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Ribotyping exhibited 10 different BglI ribotype patterns among the 58 V. cholera non-O1 strains studied. However, ribotyping showed that all isolates belonging to serogroup O12 exhibited identical ribotypes and that 83% of the serogroup O10 isolates belonged to another identical ribotype, thus showing excellent correlation between ribotypes and serogroups. Among a group of O10 and O12 isolates selected for virulence studies, none produced enterotoxin whereas the majority produced a cytotoxin, as assessed in Y1 and HeLa cells. These isolates were also negative for the gene encoding zonula occludens toxin (Zot) as assessed by a PCR assay. The isolates tested showed strong adherence and some degree of invasion in the HEp-2 cell assay, whereas none of the isolates was positive in the PCR assay for the gene encoding the toxin coregulated pilus subunit A antigen (tcpA). In the removable intestinal tie adult rabbit diarrhea model, O10 and O12 serogroup isolates produced severe diarrhea and occasionally death when rabbits were challenged with 10(10) bacterial cells. Fluid accumulation was shown in the rabbit intestinal loop test when whole cultures were injected. No significant difference in virulence was shown between serogroup O10 and O12 isolates. This study provides further evidence that V. chlorae non-O1 non-O139 strains have diarrhegenic potential for humans through a yet-undefined mechanism(s) and that such strains can cause outbreaks.
Lack of carcinogenicity of tamarind seed polysaccharide in B6C3F1 mice.	The carcinogenic potential of tamarind seed polysaccharide was examined in both sexes of B6C3F1 mice. Groups of 50 male and 50 female animals were given diets containing 0, 1.25 and 5% of tamarind seed polysaccharide for 78 wk. Body weight retardation was exhibited by the females in the 1.25 and 5% groups from 34 wk to termination. However, there were no treatment-related clinical signs or adverse effects on survival rate, food and water consumption, haematology findings or organ weights. Detailed histopathological examination also revealed no treatment-related increase in the incidence of any non-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions. These results demonstrated that tamarind seed polysaccharide is not carcinogenic in B6C3F1 mice of either sex.
Preclinical skin sensitization testing of antihistamines: guinea pig and local lymph node assay responses.	Preclinical test methods for allergic contact sensitivity have been widely used for sensitization hazard identification and, with consideration of human exposure conditions, have also been valuable tools for sensitization risk assessment. For many years, the guinea pig has been the test species of choice with a variety of test methods developed to assess the sensitization response. More recently the local lymph node assay (LLNA) in mice has been developed to provide a more objective index of sensitization potential. The standardized methods have proven to be very well suited to most situations in which potential skin sensitization of a chemical needs to be assessed before human exposure. A potential difficulty with all these relatively limited exposure preclinical test methods, however, is in the ability to detect weak contact allergens that prove to be significant clinical allergens due to chronic topical exposure, exposure to compromised skin, and/or highly exaggerated exposure through transdermal delivery. This has been shown with the transdermal drug clonidine and might also be the case for topical antihistamines. The latter are considered significant clinical contact allergens, although predictive preclinical test data are minimal or lacking. A series of guinea pig (modified Buehler) tests with two common antihistamine compounds (triprolidine and diphenhydramine) and LLNA on these and two other compounds (chlorpheniramine and promethazine) was conducted. Positive Buehler test results required use of penetrating vehicle systems and a modified nine-induction patch regimen. Positive LLNA responses were obtained with all four materials (to varying degrees) only if the application site was pre-abraded or a penetrating vehicle (dimethylformamide) was used. These data support the notion that preclinical sensitization test methods can be modified to increase sensitivity. This may be critical for preclinical assessment of topical/transdermal drugs or other materials with chronic or high-concentration exposures in man.
Relationships between descriptors for hydrophobicity and soft electrophilicity in predicting toxicity.	The toxicity of chemicals is orthogonal with individual molecular descriptors used to quantify hydrophobicity and soft electrophilicity when considering large data sets. Estimating the toxicity of reactive chemicals requires descriptors of both passive transport and the stereoelectronic interaction, which are largely independent processes. QSARs using either log P or an electronic parameter alone are only significant for sets of chemicals that represent special, albeit some important, cases in QSAR. Chemicals were clustered according to their reactivity as soft electrophiles by defining isoelectrophilic windows along the toxicity response surface. Within these narrow windows of reactivity, the variation of toxicity was explained by the variation of log P. We observed that the dependence of toxicity on log P in different isoelectrophilic windows decreased as reactivity increased. The data are consistent with toxicity models where competing nucleophilic interaction sites are distributed along the transport route of the chemicals.
Developmental toxicity evaluation of sodium fluoride administered to rats and rabbits in drinking water.	Sodium fluoride (NaF; Cas No. 7681-49-4) is used in fluoridating municipal water supplies, resulting in chronic exposure of millions of people worldwide. Because of a lack of pertinent developmental toxicity studies in the literature, sodium fluoride was administered ad libitum in deionized/filtered drinking water (to mimic human exposure) to Sprague-Dawley-derived rats (26/group) on Gestation Days (GD) 6 through 15 at levels of 0, 50, 150, or 300 ppm and New Zealand White rabbits (26/group) on GD 6 through 19 at levels of 0, 100, 200, or 400 ppm. Higher concentrations via drinking water were not practicable due to the poor palatability of sodium fluoride. Drinking water (vehicle) contained less than 0.6 ppm sodium fluoride (limit of detection) and sodium fluoride content of the feed was 12.4 ppm fluoride (rats) and 15.6 ppm fluoride (rabbits). Maternal food, water, body weights, and clinical signs were recorded at regular intervals throughout these studies. Animals were killed on GD 20 (rats) or 30 (rabbits) and examined for implant status, fetal weight, sex, and morphological development. In the high-dose group of both studies there was an initial decreased maternal body weight gain which recovered over time and a decreased water consumption--attributed to decreased palatability. No clear clinical signs of toxicity were observed. Maternal exposure to sodium fluoride during organogenesis did not significantly affect the frequency of postimplantation loss, mean fetal body weight/litter, or external, visceral or skeletal malformations in either the rat or the rabbit. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 150 ppm sodium fluoride in drinking water (approximately 18 mg/kg/day) for rats, and 200 ppm (approximately 18/mg/kg/day rabbits. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was > or = 300 ppm sodium fluoride (approximately 27 mg/kg/day) for rats and > or = 400 ppm (approximately 29 mg/kg/day) for rabbits administered during organogenesis in drinking water. The total exposure to fluoride (mg F/kg body weight/day from food and drinking water combined) in the mid- and high-dose groups for both species was > 100-fold higher than the range at 0.014-0.08 mg F/kg/day estimated for a 70-kg person from food and fluoridated (1 ppm) drinking water.
Fluoroacetate-mediated toxicity of fluorinated ethanes.	A series of 1-(di)halo-2-fluoroethanes reported in the literature to be nontoxic or of low toxicity were found to be highly toxic by the inhalation route. Experiments were performed that showed the compounds, 1,2-difluoroethane, 1-chloro-2-fluoroethane, 1-chloro-1,2-difluoroethane, and 1-bromo-2-fluoroethane to be highly toxic to rats upon inhalation for 4 hr. All four compounds had 4-hr approximate lethal concentrations of < or = 100 ppm in rats. In contrast, 1,1-difluoroethane (commonly referred to as HFC-152a) has very low acute toxicity with a 4-hr LC50 of > 400,000 ppm in rats. Rats exposed to the selected toxic fluoroethanes showed clinical signs of fluoroacetate toxicity (lethargy, hunched posture, convulsions). 1,2-Difluoroethane, 1-chloro-2-fluoroethane, 1-chloro-1,2-difluoroethane, and 1-bromo-2-fluoroethane were shown to increase concentrations of citrate in serum and heart tissue, a hallmark of fluoroacetate intoxication. 19F NMR analysis confirmed that fluoroacetate was present in the urine of rats exposed to each toxic compound. Fluorocitrate, a condensation product of fluoroacetate and oxaloacetate, was identified in the kidney of rats exposed to 1,2-difluoroethane. There was a concentration-related elevation of serum and heart citrate in rats exposed to 0-1000 ppm 1,2-fluoroethane. Serum citrate was increased up to 5-fold and heart citrate was increased up to 11-fold over control citrate levels. Metabolism of 1,2-difluoroethane by cytochrome P450 (most likely CYP2E1) is suspected because pretreatment of rats or mice with SKF-525F, disulfiram, or dimethyl sulfoxide prevented or delayed the toxicity observed in rats not pretreated. Experimental evidence indicates that the metabolism of the toxic fluoroethanes is initiated at the carbon-hydrogen bond, with metabolism to fluoroacetate via an aldehyde or an acyl fluoride. The results of these studies show that 1-(di)halo-2-fluoroethanes are highly toxic to rats and should be considered a hazard to humans unless demonstrated otherwise.
Kinetic analysis of the chronology of patulin- and gossypol-induced cytotoxicity in vitro.	Kinetic analyses of the mechanisms of patulin- and gossypol-induced cellular toxicity in an immortalized rat hepatocyte cell line were examined using a battery of vital fluorescence bioassays. Intracellular glutathione (GSH) content and intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+])i were monitored simultaneously using fluorescent probes requiring uv excitation (351-363 nm); reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial and plasma membrane potential, and intracellular pH were monitored simultaneously with visible wavelength probes (488 nm). Changes in gap junction-mediated intercellular communication (GJIC) were monitored using the gap FRAP technique. Cells were exposed to different concentrations of patulin (0, 1.0, 10, 100, and 1000 microM) or gossypol (0, 1.0, 3.0, and 10 microM). All parameters were monitored directly after addition of toxin for 20 min. The analyses provided the following chronology of cellular injury caused by patulin: simultaneous suppression of GJIC and GSH depletion --> ROS generation --> mitochondrial membrane depolarization --> simultaneous increase in [Ca2+]i and cytoplasmic acidification --> depolarization of plasma membrane. A distinct chronology of gossypol-induced cellular injury was also identified: simultaneous suppression of GJIC and generation of ROS --> cytoplasmic acidification --> simultaneous elevation of [Ca2+]i and partial depletion of GSH --> mitochondrial membrane depolarization --> depolarization of plasma membrane. This report indicates the utility of these vital assays as improved mechanistically based methods for toxicity testing in vitro.
Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity studies of poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres incorporated tetanus toxoid in Wistar rats.	Tetanus Toxoid loaded biodegradable microspheres (MTT) (poly (DL-Lactide-co-Glycolide) were administered intramuscularly to pregnant Wistar rats from Days 6 to 15 of gestation, at 1, 5 and 10-times the human equivalent dose of TT. Developmental defects in relation to soft tissues and skeleton, weight and sex of live pups and early fetal deaths from treated and control rats were analysed. The findings in treatment groups were comparable to those in the controls. These observations show that MTT was safe for pregnant rats and developing pups.
Toxicological evaluation of constructed wetland habitat sediments utilizing Hyalella azteca 10-day sediment toxicity test and bacterial bioluminescence.	A toxicological evaluation was conducted on wetland habitats created as a result of run-off from agricultural areas. These temporary wetlands were created by using drop pipes as a means of reducing erosional cutting in agricultural fields. Toxicity bioassays utilizing bacterial bioluminescence and Hyalella azteca were used to assess sediment pore water and whole sediment, respectively. Inhibition of bacterial bioluminescence was initially used to determine relative toxicities of pore water from ten wetland sites. Constructed wetland sites were compared to the University of Mississippi Biological Field Station, a relatively pristine reference site. The H. azteca ten day sediment toxicity test was utilized to assess sediment from four selected sites using survival and growth as toxicological endpoints. Results from the toxicological evaluation, along with extensive ecological evaluations, were used to assess the best approach for implementation of temporary wetland habitats with existing agricultural practices.
Environmental chemistry and toxicology of polychlorinated n-alkanes.	Polychlorinated-n-alkanes (PCAs) or chlorinated paraffins consist of C10 to C30 n-alkanes with chlorine content from 30% to 70% by mass. PCAs are used as high-temperature lubricants, plasticizers, flame retardants, and additives in adhesives, paints, rubber, and sealants. This review presents the existing data on the environmental chemistry and toxicology of PCAs and a preliminary exposure and risk assessment. There is limited information on the levels, fate, or biological effects of PCAs in the environment. This results both from the difficulty associated with quantifying PCAs, because of the complexity inherent to commercial formulations, and from the limited knowledge of their physicochemical properties and biodegradation rates. There are indications that PCAs are widespread environmental contaminants at ng/L levels in surface waters and ng/g (wet wt) levels in biota. However, environmental measurements of PCAs are very limited in the U.S. and Canada, and are only slightly more detailed in western Europe. Assuming that reported water concentrations are mainly caused by the short chain (C10-C13) compounds, aquatic organisms may be at risk from exposure to PCAs. Fugacity level II modeling for two representative PCAs, using the best available physicochemical property data and estimated degradation rates, suggested that C16C24Cl10 would achieve higher concentrations in biota, sediment, and soil than C12H20Cl6 because of slower degradation rates and lower water solubility. Environmental residence time of C16H24Cl10 is estimated to be 520 d compared to 210 d for C12H20Cl6. Future studies will require better analytical methods and reference materials certified for PCA content. Additional data are needed to evaluate exposure of biota to PCAs in the environment, particularly in light of their continued production and usage around the globe.
Cytochromes P450 and species differences in xenobiotic metabolism and activation of carcinogen.	The importance of cytochrome P450 isoforms to species differences in the metabolism of foreign compounds and activation of procarcinogens has been identified. The possible range of P450 isozymes in significant variations in toxicity exhibited by experimental rodent species may have a relevance to chemical risk assessment, especially as human P450s are likely to show changes in the way they metabolize xenobiotics. Consequently, in the safety evaluation of chemicals, we should be cautious in extrapolating results from experimental animal models to humans. This paper focuses on examples in which species differences in P450s lead to significant alterations in carcinogenic response, and includes a discussion of the current procedures for toxicity screening, with an emphasis on short-term tests.
Ecotoxicological assessment of ashes and particulate matter from fluidized bed combustion of coal.	Toxicity of ash and particulate matter from the gases generated in coal fluidized bed combustion (FBC) has been determined by the Microtox assay according to the standard leachate procedure. Results are compared with the polycylic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content of the particulate matter, which was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. Although PAHs are considered highly toxic compounds, the low ecotoxicity values obtained could be explained by the low solubility of the compounds in water. The Microtox assay may underestimate the toxicity of water-insoluble compounds unless they are previously extracted with an organic solvent. Nevertheless, this type of assay can be very useful for measuring the potential toxicity of residues when exposed to water sources such as rain water and the risk of the components being dissolved and transported by runoff water.
Evaluation of heavy metal sediment toxicity in littoral ecosystems using juveniles of the fish Sparus aurata.	The toxicity of sediments from two littoral ecosystems of the Gulf of Cadiz was tested using juveniles of the fish Sparus aurata (seabream). Concentrations of total carbon and nitrogen, organic carbon, 14 heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ag, Hg, As, Sn, V, Ni, Co, Cr), and the surfactant linear alkyl benzenesulfonate (LAS) in the sediments were measured. Chemical analysis was performed in the stations to determine the degree and nature of contamination. Four different endpoints were selected in the toxicity test: survival, superficial alteration, hematocrit analysis, and histological damage. After 14 days, survival, superficial alteration, and hematocrit analysis did not reveal effects of the different sediments tested. The histological and cellular damage revealed a more sensitive response to measured chemicals in sediments and they were found to be a powerful tool to evaluate sediment toxicity effects. Semiquantitative evaluation of the histological damage demonstrated correlation with sediment concentrations of some of the heavy metals (Cr, Cd, Pb, Ag, Cu) and the surfactant (LAS). Data derived from chemical concentrations and toxicity tests were assembled by multivariate statistical techniques (principal components analysis) to identify the ranges of chemical concentrations associated with an adverse effect. The results obtained, as suggested by site-specific sediment quality values, were the following: Cr>/=90.2; Cd>/=1.24; Pb>/=52.5; Ag>/=0.68; Cu>/=71.2; LAS>/=8.7 mg kg-1 of dry sediment. These results are mainly in concordance with studies performed in other areas of the world and therefore support wide application of the method.
Immortalized mouse odontoblast cell line MO6-G3 application for in vitro biocompatibility testing.	This study was designed to determine the usefulness of an established stable immortalized mouse odontoblast cell line (MO6-G3) for dental material biocompatibility testing. Using a standard toxicity assay based on cell respiratory activity, the response to MO6-G3 cells was compared to the mouse fibroblastic cell line, L929, presently used for dental materials testing. The dental resin monomer TEGDMA was used as the dental material for the assay.
A review of nonclinical toxicology studies of becaplermin (rhPDGF-BB).	Becaplermin (recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB [BB homodimer, rhPDGF-BB]) has demonstrated a favorable safety profile in a series of nonclinical studies designed to assess its systemic toxicity, sensitization, local irritation, and genotoxic potential. No significant local or systemic toxicity directly attributable to becaplermin was observed following single and multiple intravenous or subcutaneous administration at doses up to 3 mg/kg in monkeys. Administration of single large intravenous doses (up to 100 mg/kg) and repeated dosing at 1 or 3 mg/kg in mice resulted in rapidly reversible vasodilation and central nervous system depression. In a bone-toxicity study, becaplermin produced histomorphologic changes suggestive of accelerated bone remodeling, which were judged to be potentially reversible. Similar findings have not been observed in humans. Although becaplermin was not considered a dermal or ocular irritant, some skin-sensitizing effects were observed in animals; this finding was not unexpected for a recombinant human-derived protein. Becaplermin was not genotoxic in a variety of in vitro assays and in one in vivo assay.
Subchronic toxicity of human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis combination therapies in B6C3F1 mice.	Combination therapy with anti-HIV drugs and opportunistic infection drugs is a common practice in treatment of AIDS patients. Although toxic effects of most individual therapies are known, the toxic potential of most combination therapies has not been established. To understand the toxic consequences of combination therapies, the commonly used anti-HIV drug 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) and tuberculosis infection therapies pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and rifampicin were evaluated by 13-week gavage studies in B6C3F1 mice, either alone or AZT in combination with one of the antituberculosis drugs. The doses include AZT 100, 200, and 400; pyrazinamide 1000 and 1500; isoniazid 50, 100, and 150; and rifampicin 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day. AZT alone caused hematopoietic toxicity with dose-related bone marrow suppression, macrocytic anemia, and thrombocytosis. Pyrazinamide or isoniazid alone at the doses tested did not cause significant toxicity. Rifampicin alone caused hematopoietic toxicity and possibly mild hepatic toxicity. Pyrazinamide below 10 times the therapeutic dose when given with AZT did not increase the hematological toxicity of AZT. Isoniazid markedly increased the hematological toxicity of AZT and contributed to mortality at 3 to 4 times the therapeutic dose combinations. Administration of rifampicin with AZT at the calculated therapeutic doses resulted in toxicity of far greater magnitude than that caused by AZT or rifampicin alone. Combination treatment with AZT and rifampicin caused severe anemia with mortality at 2 to 4 times the therapeutic dose combinations. However, AZT did not enhance the hepatotoxicity of rifampicin. Increased hematopoietic toxicity of AZT when given in combination with the above antituberculosis drugs may be due to changes in the metabolism of AZT. Results of these studies indicate that toxicological effects of combination therapies could be considerably more severe than and different from the toxicity of individual therapies.
Assessment of the developmental toxicity, metabolism, and placental transfer of Di-n-butyl phthalate administered to pregnant rats.	The developmental toxicity and placental transfer of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats given a single oral dose of DBP on Gestational Day 14. In the developmental toxicity study, dams were dosed with 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, or 2 g DBP/kg and were necropsied on GD21. Increased incidence of resorptions and reduced fetal body weight were observed at 1.5 and 2 g/kg. Higher incidences of skeletal variations were found at doses > or = at 1 g/kg. No embryotoxic or teratogenic effects were observed at a dose of 0.5 g/kg. In the placental transfer study, dams were dosed with 0.5 or 1.5 g [14C]DBP/kg. Maternal and embryonic tissues were collected at intervals from 0.5 to 48 h. Embryonic tissues accounted for less than 0.12-0.15% of the administered dose. Levels of radiocarbon in placenta and embryo were one-third or less of those in maternal plasma. No accumulation of radioactivity was observed in the maternal or embryonic tissues. From HPLC analyses, it was shown that unchanged DBP and its metabolites mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) and MBP glucuronide were rapidly transferred to the embryonic tissues, where their levels were constantly lower than those in maternal plasma. MBP accounted for most of the radioactivity recovered in maternal plasma, placenta, and embryo. Unchanged DBP was found only in small amounts. These findings support the hypothesis that MBP, a potent teratogen, largely contributes to the embryotoxic effects of DBP.
Acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity studies with felbamate, 2-phenyl-1,3-propanediol dicarbamate.	Felbamate, 2-phenyl-1,3-propanediol dicarbamate, is a novel anticonvulsant that is effective against both chemically and electrically induced seizures in laboratory animals. Acute, subchronic, and chronic studies were conducted in mice, rats, and dogs to establish a preclinical safety profile for this drug. Clinical signs following single intraperitoneal doses included hypoactivity, tremors, decreased muscle tone, ataxia, prostration, and labored breathing. Death was observed after intraperitoneal but not oral administration. A consistent drug-related effect noted in all multiple-dose studies with this compound was decreased body weight and food consumption. The only other consistent change noted in multiple-dose studies with felbamate was an increase in liver weight (relative and absolute) in the rat and dog which was accompanied in some cases by increases in serum enzyme levels. No histopathological changes were observed in the liver that could explain these elevated serum enzyme levels. Based on the results of these studies it was concluded that long-term administration of felbamate in human clinical trials was warranted.
Preclinical evaluation of radiopharmaceutical toxicological prerequisites.	Radiopharmaceuticals should be tested in a battery of assays to evaluate human risk assessment, as for every drug. The battery of tests used for this evaluation should be adapted taking into account the specificity of radiopharmaceuticals and particularly the short duration of treatment, the toxicity associated both to the unlabelled part of the molecule and to the radioactivity itself, but also to a specific type of impurities due to the radiolytic degradation products.
