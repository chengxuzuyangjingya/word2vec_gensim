Temporal differences in membrane loss lead to distinct reticulocyte features in hereditary spherocytosis and in immune hemolytic anemia.	Spherocytic red cells with reduced membrane surface area are a feature of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and some forms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). It is generally assumed that membrane loss in spherocytic red cells occurs during their sojourn in circulation. The structural basis for membrane loss in HS is improper assembly of membrane proteins, whereas in AIHA it is due to partial phagocytosis of circulating red cells by macrophages. A hypothesis was formed that these different mechanisms should lead to temporal differences in surface area loss during red cell genesis and during sojourn in circulation in these 2 spherocytic syndromes. It was proposed that cell surface loss could begin at the reticulocyte stage in HS, whereas surface area loss in AIHA involves only circulating mature red cells. The validity of this hypothesis was established by documenting differences in cellular features of reticulocytes in HS and AIHA. Using a novel technique to quantitate cell surface area, the decreased membrane surface area of both reticulocytes and mature red cells in HS compared with normal cells was documented. In contrast, in AIHA only mature red cells but not reticulocytes exhibited decreased membrane surface area. These data imply that surface area loss in HS, but not in AIHA, is already present at the circulating reticulocyte stage. These findings imply that loss of cell surface area is an early event during genesis of HS red cells and challenge the existing concepts that surface area loss in HS occurs predominantly during the sojourn of mature red cells in circulation.
