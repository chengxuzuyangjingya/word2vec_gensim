Randomized, double-blind placebo- and tolterodine-controlled trial of the once-daily antimuscarinic agent solifenacin in patients with symptomatic overactive bladder.	To assess in a phase 3a trial the efficacy of solifenacin succinate, a once-daily oral antimuscarinic agent in development at 5-mg and 10-mg dosage strengths, for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) (Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) compared with placebo in patients with symptoms of OAB, i.e. urgency, incontinence, and frequency, with additional objectives being to assess the safety and tolerability of solifenacin and to compare the efficacy and safety of solifenacin with tolterodine 2 mg twice daily.
Improved quality of life in patients with overactive bladder symptoms treated with solifenacin.	To assess the effect of solifenacin succinate treatment on quality of life (QoL) measured in clinical trials in patients with overactive bladder (OAB).
Long-term open-label solifenacin treatment associated with persistence with therapy in patients with overactive bladder syndrome.	To examine safety and tolerability findings as primary endpoints, and efficacy outcomes as secondary endpoints, of solifenacin treatment over a period of up to 1 year. Long-term efficacy in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome depends in part on the patient's persistence with pharmacologic therapy. Agents with a favourable therapeutic index supporting high levels of patient satisfaction and persistence are needed.
Effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of solifenacin in men and women.	The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin succinate (YM905; Vesicare), a new, bladder-selective, muscarinic receptor antagonist for the treatment of overactive bladder in young/middle-aged and elderly subjects were compared.
Reductions in overactive bladder-related incontinence from pooled analysis of phase III trials evaluating treatment with solifenacin.	The embarrassment and social stigma associated with urinary incontinence (UI) in overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) sufferers is a major reason for individuals to seek help for their condition. An analysis of 1,873 subjects with OAB with UI was conducted to assess the efficacy of solifenacin in reducing incontinence in a pooled population from four phase III clinical trials, stratified by severity of incontinence, urgency, and other key factors at baseline. Subjects were randomized to either 5 or 10 mg of solifenacin once daily or placebo for 12 weeks. More than 50% of the total population became continent at study end, with either dose of solifenacin (P<0.01 vs placebo). Significant reductions in incontinence episodes and higher rates of attainment of continence vs placebo were observed irrespective of age or severity of incontinence or urgency at baseline with solifenacin treatment. Treatment was well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events being mild in nature. Solifenacin is an effective antimuscarinic agent for the treatment of incontinence associated with OAB.
Pharmacokinetic effect of ketoconazole on solifenacin in healthy volunteers.	Solifenacin succinate (YM905) is a new, once-daily, orally administered muscarinic receptor antagonist designed to treat overactive bladder. The metabolism of solifenacin involves hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4; therefore, the pharmacokinetics of solifenacin may be affected by drugs that inhibit CYP3A4. This study aimed to examine the effects of co-administration of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of solifenacin in healthy volunteers. In a single-site, open-label, monosequence, crossover study, 17 healthy men and women aged 18 to 65 years received a single 10 mg oral dose of solifenacin, which is is the highest available dose. After a 14-day wash-out period, they began 20 days of oral ketoconazole at a dose of 200 mg once daily. A single 10 mg dose of solifenacin was administered again on day 7 of ketoconazole treatment. Pharmacokinetics was assessed using the standard measurements of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax, area under the curve (AUC), and elimination half-life (t1/2). Co-administration of ketoconazole resulted in a 1.43 times increase in the C(max) of solifenacin and an approximately 2 times increase in AUC. The mean t1/2 of solifenacin was extended from 49.3 to 77.5 hr whereas time to Cmax did not change. No substantial increase in the overall rate of adverse events, and no significant effects on vital signs, electrocardiography, clinical laboratory values, or physical examinations were noted. Administration of 200 mg ketoconazole once daily in healthy male volunteers resulted in a 2 times increase in exposure of a single 10 mg dose of solifenacin. Since ketoconazole is one of the strongest inhibitors of CYP3A4, it is expected that co-administration of other CYP3A4 inhibitors will not result in a stronger increase in solifenacin exposure.
Pharmacological characterization of a new antimuscarinic agent, solifenacin succinate, in comparison with other antimuscarinic agents.	Solifenacin succinate [YM905; (3R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl(1S)-1-phenyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxylate monosuccinate] is a new muscarinic receptor antagonist developed for the treatment of overactive bladder. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimuscarinic properties of solifenacin and to compare the results with those obtained for tolterodine, oxybutynin, darifenacin, propiverine and atropine. In radioligand receptor binding assay, Ki values of solifenacin for human muscarinic M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5 receptors were 26, 170, 12, 110 and 31 nM, respectively. In isolated rat urinary bladder, solifenacin competitively antagonized carbachol-induced contractions, with a pA2 value of 7.44+/-0.09. In these in vitro studies, the antimuscarinic action of solifenacin was more potent than that of propiverine and less potent than those of tolterodine, oxybutynin, darifenacin and atropine. In anesthetized rats, solifenacin and oxybutynin increased the maximum bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner and also decreased the maximum intravesical pressure. The dosages required to produce a 30% increase in maximum bladder capacity (ED30 values) of solifenacin and oxybutynin were 0.35 and 0.30 mg/kg i.v., respectively, indicating approximately equal efficacies. These results support the fact that solifenacin, similarly to currently used antimuscarinic agents, is an effective agent in the treatment of overactive bladder symptoms such as urinary frequency and urge incontinence.
Solifenacin for overactive bladder with incontinence: symptom bother and health-related quality of life outcomes.	Approximately one-third of patients with overactive bladder (OAB) experience incontinence, a bothersome symptom with a clear negative effect on quality of life.
Listening to the patient: a flexible approach to the use of antimuscarinic agents in overactive bladder syndrome.	Several studies with modern antimuscarinics have used a flexible-dosing strategy. We reviewed data from several studies with solifenacin, darifenacin and oxybutynin extended-release that evaluated the impact of dose flexibility on clinical management. A strategy based on patient-requested dose increases was found to be consistently effective in improving the symptoms of overactive bladder. Patients requesting a dose increase often had more severe symptoms at baseline than those who did not request a dose increase, and these patients derived most benefit from the increased dose. Specialists and family doctors should encourage open discussion with their patients about requesting dose titration so as to meet patients' individual needs.

To compare the efficacy of flexible-dose solifenacin 5/10 mg with and without simplified bladder training in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome.
The forefront for novel therapeutic agents based on the pathophysiology of lower urinary tract dysfunction: ameliorative effect of solifenacin succinate (Vesicare), a bladder-selective antimuscarinic agent, on overactive bladder symptoms, especially urgency episodes.	Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is a common condition that is most often observed in the elderly. Pharmacological treatment with muscarinic receptor antagonists has been most widely used for OAB. An antimuscarinic agent, solifenacin, showed the highest affinity for the muscarinic M(3) receptor, which mediates urinary bladder contraction. In preclinical studies, solifenacin exhibited a highly bladder-selective profile compared with other antimuscarinic agents. Solifenacin was also shown to increase bladder capacity without affecting residual urine in an OAB model of rats. Urgency is now considered to result from overactivation of afferent nerves from the urinary bladder. It has been reported that afferent nerves are located adjacent to the urothelium, and stimulation of muscarinic receptors expressed on the urothelium may contribute to the activation of afferent nerves via non-neuronal ATP release. Solifenacin produces its inhibitory effect on bladder afferent activity partly via the suppression of non-neuronal ATP release. Clinically, solifenacin ameliorates all symptoms in OAB patients; and in particular, it produces a significant decrease in urgency episodes, which is the principal symptom of OAB. The pharmacological profile of solifenacin is therefore considered to contribute to its beneficial effects of high efficacy against OAB symptoms with good tolerability.
Solifenacin pharmacology.	Antimuscarinics are the drugs of choice for the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome, and their benefit/risk ratio depends largely on selectivity for the different subtypes of muscarinic receptors. Solifenacin is the antimuscarinic that presents greatest selectivity for M3 bladder receptors, which may translate into a lower incidence of undesirable effects related to other receptor subtypes. Metabolic pathways of the antimuscarinics may impact efficacy and appearance of interactions. Solifenacin is metabolized only by the CYP3A4, giving three inactive metabolites and one with a similar activity to the original compound. However, other drugs in the group are also a substrate for the CYP 2D6 which presents polymorphisms, whereby their pharmacokinetics may be modified in slow metabolizers. The risk of interactions of solifenacin is low, and it is lower than that of the antimuscarinics which are also metabolized by the CYP 2D6. The unaltered fraction of solifenacin which is eliminated in urine, together with the active metabolite, can contribute to the therapeutic effect by acting on the urothelium receptors. It is not necessary to adjust doses of solifenacin in elderly patients or those with moderate liver or kidney impairment.

Urinary urgency: a review of its assessment as the key symptom of the overactive bladder syndrome.	Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition that is associated with a negative impact on quality of life. Urgency is the essential symptom when making a diagnosis, and its effective treatment is a principal aim in OAB management. However, urgency has often been relatively neglected as an outcome measure in clinical trials. The aim of this review is, first, to describe the background to urgency in OAB; second, to determine whether results provided by several tools used to measure urgency in clinical trials could be cross-related to each other in a meaningful way.
Combined antimuscarinics for treatment of neurogenic overactive bladder.	Antimuscarinic drugs are the first line pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder, but they are not always effective to achieve complete continence. Nevertheless in some patients urodynamic investigations reveal insufficient effects with continuing incontinence events even with dose optimization. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of association of Oxybutynin chloride, Trospium chloride and Solifenacin succinate administered orally for a minimum of 12 weeks in subjects with suprasacral spinal cord injury with urge-incontinence, urodynamicproven neurogenic detrusor overactivity dysfunction and detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia to improve level of continence, reduce the risks of urologic complications and enhance QOL. This study was a randomized, double blind, controlled, balanced-parallel-groups investigation of orally administed Oxybutynin in addition to Trospium chloride in the first group and Oxybutynin in addition to Solifenacin in the other group. A total of 12 patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity and clean intermittent catheterization were allocated into two treatment groups: 5 mg tablet of Oxibutinin and 20 mg tablet of Trospium Chloride were administered respectively 3 times a day and 4 times a day in the first group (Group A). 5 mg tablet of Oxibutinin and 10 mg tablet of Solifenacin were administered respective 3 times a day and once daily in the second group (Group B). In both group of patients we found a significant decrease in incontinence episodes, with an improvement of bladder compliance, bladder capacity and volume voided. Side effects were higher in patients of group B, but in generally well tolerated. In conclusion, a combined antimuscarinic treatment might be a right option for patients affected by neurogenic bladder refractory to previous antimuscarinic monotherapy, and might slow down or delay other more invasive treatments.

Combining benefits of an adrenergic and a muscarinic blocker in a single formulation - a pharmacokinetic evaluation.	A pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study was conducted in Asian subjects, to compare a fixed dose combination capsule single oral dose of alpha adrenoceptor blocker-Alfuzosin hydrochloride 10mg extended release and muscarinic antagonists-Solifenacin succinate 5mg against individually administered Xatral XL 10mg tablets (Alfuzosin) of Sanofi Synthelabo Limited, United Kingdom (UK) and Vesicare 5mg tablets (Solifenacin) of Astellas Pharma Limited, UK under fed conditions. Blood samples were collected pre-dose up to 72 h post dose for determination of plasma Alfuzosin and Solifenacin concentrations and calculation of the pharmacokinetic parameters. ANOVA was performed on the log (natural)-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters. A 90% confidence interval for the ratios of the test and reference product averages (least square means) were calculated for alfuzosin and solifenacin. The 90% confidence intervals obtained for alfuzosin for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were 102.74-122.75%, 95.84-116.96% and 95.82-116.76%, respectively. The 90% confidence intervals obtained for Solifenacin for Cmax, and AUC0-72 were 89.55-97.91% and 90.47-99.38%, respectively. Based on the results, the fixed dose combination was concluded to be bioequivalent to individually administered products.
