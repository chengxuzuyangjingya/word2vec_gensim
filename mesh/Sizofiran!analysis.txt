Detection of immunoreactive schizophyllan by solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.	In order to detect immunoreactive schizophyllan (SPG), one of the beta-1,3-glucans in solution, a murine anti-schizophyllan monoclonal antibody, SPG1-HS, was used as a primary antibody for solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Polysaccharide-bovine serum albumin (BSA), and polysaccharide-bovine hemoglobin (Hb) conjugate were prepared as an antigen. The absorbance at 490 nm in ELISA was directly proportional to the SPG concentration in SPG-BSA or SPG-Hb conjugates, allowing the accurate measurement of SPG at concentrations of more than 1.0 microgram/ml. Also, this ELISA detected SPG in SPG-BSA and SPG-Hb conjugates in human serum in a similar manner. These results suggest that this ELISA is applicable for the determination of SPG concentration in SPG-BSA and SPG-Hb conjugates in human tissue and blood.
Insight into the distribution of molecular weights and higher-order structure of hyaluronans and some beta-(1 --> 3)-glucans by size exclusion chromatography.	The effects of high energy ultrasound and slightly raised temperature combined with the denaturing action of dimethylsulphoxide on the molecular weight and higher-order structure of hyaluronans and some beta-(1 --> 3)-glucans were studied by means of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) technique. Some experimental conditions connected with the (bio-)polymer sample preparation prior to its SEC analysis are overviewed in the light of informational relevance of studies where the action of a physical and/or chemical agent changes the hydrodynamic size of the m omolecule.
