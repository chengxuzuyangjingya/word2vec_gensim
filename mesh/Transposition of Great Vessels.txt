THE ROLE OF SURGERY IN THE TREATMENT OF TRANSPOSITION OF THE GREAT VESSELS.	In 28 infants and children with complete transposition of the great vessels, atrial septal defects were created utilizing an open technique with inflow caval occlusion and moderate hypothermia. Of the 12 infants for whom operation was necessary during the first two weeks of life only two survived, suggesting that this technique is not adequate for infants at this age. Only four of the 16 children operated on between the ages of two weeks and three years failed to survive. Two of these died because of pre-existing non-cardiac conditions. Seven children with associated systemic-to-pulmonary shunts survived; the open technique may be preferable in this particular group. Despite the initial improvement afforded by this procedure, three sudden late deaths occurred. For this reason, and because of the danger of early development of pulmonary vascular disease, total operative correction of the malformation should be performed early.
Transvenous pacing via a disconnected superior vena cava in a patient with transposition of the great arteries.	We describe successful implantation of a permanent pacemaker via the right subclavian vein in a 28-year-old man with operated transposition of the great arteries where the superior vena cava is completely disconnected from the systemic venous atrium following a previous Glenn procedure.
