Technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime single photon emission tomography in febrile convulsions.	We report our initial experience with technetium-99m hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (99mTC-HMPAO) brain single photon emission tomography (SPET) in the investigation of 19 children presenting with febrile convulsions. Two patients with complex febrile convulsions showed focal SPET lesions contralateral to the neurological deficit. However, in 9 out of 17 patients with simple febrile convulsions, focally disturbed perfusion was shown. In 4 out of 6 patients with electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities on admittance, SPET revealed at least 2 focal lesions. The temporofrontal region was the one most commonly involved. The SPET findings presented here also suggest a temporal relationship with the febrile convulsions, with markedly fewer lesions if examined after 12 days. In our initial experience, perfusion SPET did not show any particular pattern helpful in the differential diagnosis of the child presenting with febrile convulsions. Physiopathologically, our findings may support the hypothesis that brain tissue is regionally more vulnerable to fever, in patients presenting with febrile convulsions.
