Targeting the BLyS-APRIL signaling pathway in SLE.	The B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS)-A PRoliferation-Inducing Ligand (APRIL) signaling pathway has an important role in the selection, maturation and survival of B cells and plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The inhibition of BLyS, a survival factor for transitional and mature B cells, has recently proven to be successful in large phase III clinical trials that led to the approval of an anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody (belimumab) for the treatment of SLE. Yet, there is currently a need to both understand better the mechanisms of action of belimumab in SLE and better define the subsets of patients that are more likely to respond to the drug.
Therapeutic targeting of the BAFF/APRIL axis in systemic lupus erythematosus.	The B-cell activating factor (BAFF) axis comprises two ligands (BAFF and APRIL) and three receptors (BCMA, TACI, BR3). BAFF is a vital B-cell survival factor and overexpression of BAFF in both mice and humans is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The anti-BAFF monoclonal antibody (mAb), belimumab, was recently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of adult SLE patients, and three additional BAFF antagonists (atacicept, blisibimod, tabalumab) are presently being evaluated in SLE Phase-III trials.
