Medical aspects of the squint operation as day surgery - a contribution to quality control]	The strained situation in the financing of our health system makes it necessary that we reassess therapeutic procedures and their management.

Afterwards we examined their acceptance in cooperation with the Department for Interdisciplinary Quality Management.
