Changes in the upper airway in patients with sleep obstructive apnea and/or chronic snoring treated with mandibular appliances]	We have analysed the possible modifications in the upper airways (UA) of the lateral cranial teleradiography in 25 adult males with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSAS) and/or chronic snoring, with dental and squeletal Class I, treated with advance mandibular appliances (MAD). Results of our study showed a clear increase of the UA in the oropharynx in all the subjects studied. The study of the changes in the UA using the lateral cranial teleradiography in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the MAD can contribute to consider its effectiveness in the cases with OSAS when they are indicated. However it will be needed to contrast these results with polisomnography.
