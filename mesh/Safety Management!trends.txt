Economic growth and the incidence of occupational injuries in Austria.	The aim of this paper was to analyze the impact of economic growth measured by real gross domestic product (GDP) on the incidence of occupational injuries in Austria.
A roadmap to diffuse ergonomic innovations in the construction industry: there is nothing so practical as a good theory.	Despite the availability of resources and practices that would reduce work-related morbidity and mortality in the construction industry, their diffusion to workers has been slow, partly because the ties between management and trade workers are weak. In promoting an innovation, it is necessary to target the stakeholders who will be making the decisions related to it. The authors' focus is on ergonomics, but their observations may be applied more broadly to other areas of intervention-effectiveness research.
