Sequence of oral bacterial co-adhesion and non-contact brushing.	Non-contact plaque removal offers advantages in interproximal spaces, fissures, and pockets. It requires the generation of strong fluid flows and the inclusion of air bubbles to become effective. A pair of co-adhering streptococci and actinomyces has been used previously to demonstrate non-contact removal by sonic brushing. Here we determined the influence of the sequence of co-adhesion of streptococci and actinomyces on non-contact removal from a salivary pellicle by rotary and sonic brushing. After bacterial adhesion, pellicles were brushed in a wet and immersed state, with a distance up to 4 mm to the bristle tips. Bacteria adhering to pellicles from the sequence streptococci followed by actinomyces appeared more difficult to remove and left more large co-aggregates than from the sequence actinomyces followed by streptococci. At contact, rotary and sonic brushing performed equally well in bacterial removal, while at 4 mm, both had lost some efficacy.
Recurrent infective endocarditis. A case report]	We report the case of a 63-year old patient presenting five infective endocarditis (IE) in a 13-years period, with different types of streptococcus. No entrance way had been found until the last relapse occurring on mitro-aortic bioprosthesis. This recurrence leads to the diagnosis of caecal adenocarcinoma by coloscopy, preceded and guided by PET scanner. It seems to be the initial entrance way which had been unrecognized because of its small size and its particular location, that is very difficult to observe by coloscopy. Recurrent streptococcus IE are rare and severe. When a gut or colic tumor is suspected, PET scan seems to be helpful in etiological survey.
