Natural deletion of L35Y36 in p6 gag eliminate LYPXnL/ALIX auxiliary virus release pathway in HIV-1 subtype C.	Natural loss of L35Y36 residues in ALIX binding site of HIV-1 subtype C was found to prevent the p6 gag-ALIX interaction. Over expression of ALIX 364-716 (V-domain) unlike pNL4.3 (subtype B), also did not inhibit the release of chimeric pNL4.3 expressing subtype C p6 late domain. Loss of V domain binding consequently affected the ALIX mediated particle release in the absence of PTAP/TSG101 pathway. Our data indicated absence of LYPXnL/ALIX pathway in HIV-1 subtype C.
