Orbital pseudotumor in the differential diagnosis of pediatric uveitis.	Pediatric orbital pseudotumor may be associated with iritis, unlike the adult form of this disorder. However, orbital pseudotumor is seldom considered in the differential diagnosis of childhood uveitis. We report two cases of children with uveitis who were ultimately diagnosed as having orbital pseudotumor. No proptosis was noted in either child. For those pediatric patients with a persistent or recurrent uveitis and a previous negative diagnostic workup, the possibility of an orbital pseudotumor should be considered and ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or computed tomography performed.
