Catalytic asymmetric total synthesis of (S)-(-)-zearalenone, a novel lipoxygenase inhibitor.	A catalytic asymmetric synthesis of (S)-(-)-zearalenone is reported using asymmetric allylic alkylation for the introduction of the stereocenter. (S)-(-)-Zearalenone turned out to be a novel lipoxygenase inhibitor.
