The contributions of Csaba Horváth to liquid chromatography.	This article is not a biographic description of the life of Csaba Horváth, but an attempt to describe his most important contributions to liquid chromatography, as viewed by an author who himself started with HPLC in 1973. With the introduction of columns packed with rigid pellicular particles, which could withstand high pressures, the combination of fast separations with high efficiency was designated high pressure liquid chromatography about 35 years ago. The contribution of Horváth to the birth of modern LC was to imagine the potential for high-speed separations in LC by transferring ideas and technology from gas chromatography. From this time, his strong participation in understanding and describing the processes of separation science made him a leading scientist in fundamental studies of separation principles until his passing away in April 2004. In addition to being one of the forefathers of modern liquid chromatography, Csaba Horváth described both the ionic interactions and the hydrophobic interactions on ion exchangers as well as on reversed phase materials and developed a theoretical basis for understanding these processes. If one person should be mentioned as the inventor of ion-pair chromatography of organic compounds, of hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and of the theoretical basis for reversed phase chromatography, this person is Csaba Horváth. Throughout the last 30 years he also had a strong interest in studying proteins in separation processes, and in the last decade he made valuable contributions to capillary electrochromatography, particularly for separation of proteins on monolithic columns. For this author is difficult to find another person who has had a greater impact on liquid chromatography than Csaba Horváth.
