Hideyo Noguchi's research on yellow fever (1918-1928) in the pre-electron microscopic era.	One of the low points in Hideyo Noguchi's career as a pioneer medical microbiologist was his investigations on yellow fever between 1918 and 1924 in Central and South America. His discovery that spirochete Leptospira icteroides was the causative pathogen of yellow fever was discredited in 1927. This paper evaluates the situation under which Noguchi conducted his experiments and assesses the causes which might have resulted in his erroneous interpretation in the pre-electron microscopic era. Even 60 years after Noguchi's untimely death, much remains to be known about the virulence of pathogenic strains of yellow fever.
Recovery of virus from the liver of children with fatal dengue: reflections on the pathogenesis of the disease and its possible analogy with that of yellow fever.	Dengue viruses types 2 or 3 were recovered from the liver of 5 out of 17 children who were suspected to have died of dengue. Among the 5 children with liver isolates, virus was also recovered from the heart blood, spleen and midbrain of one and from the spleen of another. Attention is drawn to the many similarities in the clinical manifestations of yellow fever and severe dengue, their indistinguishable liver lesions and the close relationship of the viruses themselves. In view of the liver isolates reported here and those described by others, it is suggested that the pathogenesis of the two diseases may be analogous.
Analysis of a yellow fever virus isolated from a fatal case of vaccine-associated human encephalitis.	The virulence of a yellow fever (YF) virus (P-16065) isolated from a fatal case of vaccine-associated viral encephalitis was investigated. P-16065 appeared identical to its parent vaccine virus (17D-204 USA, lot 6145) when examined with monoclonal antibodies except that YF wild type-specific MAb S24 recognized P-16065 but not 17D-204 USA 6145. Thus, a mutation of at least one epitope on the envelope (E) protein had occurred. Unlike 17D-204 USA 6145 and other 17D vaccine viruses, P-16065 was neuroinvasive and virulent for mice after intranasal inoculation, and neurovirulent for monkeys after intracerebral inoculation. The E protein of P-16065 differed from 17D-204 USA by two amino acids at positions 155 and 303. Changes at amino acid position 155 are found in other YF vaccine viruses that are not neurovirulent, and it is therefore postulated that the change at position 303 is involved in the alteration of the phenotype of P-16065 and may be important for virulence of YF virus.
