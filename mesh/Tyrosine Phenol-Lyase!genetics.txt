The mechanism of alpha-proton isotope exchange in amino acids catalysed by tyrosine phenol-lyase. What is the role of quinonoid intermediates?	To shed light on the mechanism of isotopic exchange of alpha-protons in amino acids catalyzed by pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes, we studied the kinetics of quinonoid intermediate formation for the reactions of tyrosine phenol-lyase with L-phenylalanine, L-methionine, and their alpha-deuterated analogues in D2O, and we compared the results with the rates of the isotopic exchange under the same conditions. We have found that, in the L-phenylalanine reaction, the internal return of the alpha-proton is operative, and allowing for its effect, the exchange rate is accounted for satisfactorily. Surprisingly, for the reaction with L-methionine, the enzymatic isotope exchange went much faster than might be predicted from the kinetic data for quinonoid intermediate formation. This result allows us to suggest the existence of an alternative, possibly concerted, mechanism of alpha-proton exchange.
Effective production of 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-DOPA) with Erwinia herbicola cells carrying a mutant transcriptional regulator TyrR.	The enzymatic production of 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-DOPA) using Erwinia herbicola cells involves the action of tyrosine phenol-lyase (Tpl, EC 4.1.99.2). Since Tpl is only synthesized under L-tyrosine-induced conditions, the addition of L-tyrosine to the medium is unavoidable when preparing cells (the enzyme source), but severely impedes the pure preparation of the final product L-DOPA. We circumvented this problem by using recombinant E. herbicola cells carrying a mutant transcriptional regulator TyrR, which is capable of activating the tpl promoter in the absence of L-tyrosine.
