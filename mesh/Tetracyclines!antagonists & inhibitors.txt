Tetracycline inactivation by magnesium sulfate in testing for microbial contamination by the membrane filtration method]	It was shown that the residual amounts of tetracyclines adsorbed on membrane filters may be inactivated by addition of 2M magnesium sulphate solution to the agar for placing the filters after filtration. The antibiotic inactivation increases the possibilities of the test for antibiotic sensitivity of the microflora present in the drugs and may be used in determination of microbial dissmination of non-injection tetracyclines.
