A suggested technique for "orthotopic" heart transplantation in a patient with situs inversus.	We describe a technique for "orthotopic" heart transplantation in a patient with situs inversus. The left atrial, aortic, and pulmonary artery anastomoses were performed directly, in the usual manner. The recipient's right atrium was converted into a tunnel, and the donor's right atrium was left intact. Anastomoses were therefore required between the 2 inferior venae cavae (by direct end-to-end anastomosis) and the 2 superior venae cavae (necessitating the insertion of a Dacron-graft). We suggest that even simpler techniques, perhaps not requiring the use of an artificial vascular prosthesis, are possible.
