Morphological criteria of treatment efficiency in patients with acute pyoinflammatory diseases of the maxillofacial area]	Morphological parameters (tissue necrosis area, area of connective tissue sites, neutrophil/round cells ratio, activities of the nucleolar organizer areas) are suggested as criteria for evaluating the treatment efficiency in patients with maxillofacial pyoinflammatory diseases.
The clinical evaluation of acetoxyethylcefuroxime in dentistry]	The study examines the use of an oral antibiotic with a wide spectrum of action tested in dentistry belonging to the cephalosporin class: acetoxyethylcefuroxime. The pharmaceutical industry has succeeded in synthesising a prodrug of parenteral cephalosporin "Metoxyrinic cefuroxime sodium", thus resolving the problems presented by earlier molecules such as: scarce bioavailability, poor palatability and collateral effects at a gastroenteric level. This is a 2nd generation cephalosporin whose mechanism of action consists in the capacity to selectively block the synthesis of the peptidoglycan, a fundamental component of the cell wall of both Gram+ and Gram- bacteria. The study, which was performed in the Division of Odontostomatology of the Mauriziano Hospital in Turin, examined 59 patients suffering from some of the most commonplace dental pathologies such as: apical periodontitis-alveolitis-odontogenic abscesses-eighth teeth in dysodontiasis-maxillary cysts. The following clinical parameters were evaluated in both outpatients and those undergoing surgery: swelling, pain, lymphoadenopathy at the start of treatment, and at days 3 and 5 of treatment. A 250 mg tablet was administered every 12 hours for 5 days. Owing to the rapid resolution of symptoms and the limited collateral effects observed, the authors conclude that the drug may be regarded as the elective form of treatment.
