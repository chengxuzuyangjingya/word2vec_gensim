Treatment of multiple trichoepitheliomas with topical imiquimod and tretinoin.	An 11-year-old white girl presented multiple flesh-colored dome-shaped papules on the forehead, nose, scalp, and posterior neck. The lesions had been present for 2 years and were asymptomatic. Family history was negative for skin diseases. A skin biopsy specimen revealed histopathology consistent with trichoepitheliomas. Treatment of multiple trichoepitheliomas is usually difficult. Methods reported in the literature include laser treatment, surgery, cryotherapy, electrodessication, and radiation. The parents were concerned about the risk of scarring and wanted to pursue a nonscarring treatment. The patient was initially treated with topical imiquimod three times a week. She progressively increased the frequency of application to twice daily and added topical tretinoin gel once daily to her regimen for more resistant lesions. After 3 years of treatment, the patient experienced approximately 80% clearing of lesions without scarring. The advantage of using this nonsurgical treatment is no scarring, painless, and no need for other invasive procedures such as injection of local anesthetic.
