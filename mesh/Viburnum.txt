Rearranged vibsane-type diterpenes from Viburnum awabuki and photochemical reaction of vibsanin B.	Nine new diterpenes, neovibsanin D (1), 7-epi-neovibsanin D (2), 15-O-methylneovibsanin F (3), 14-epi-15-O-methylneovibsanin F (4), 15-O-methyl-18-oxoneovibsanin F (5), 2-O-methylneovibsanin H (6), 2-O-methylneovibsanin I (7), neovibsanin G (8), and 14-epi-neovibsanin G (9), were isolated from a methanol extract of the leaves of Viburnum awabuki. Their structures were elucidated to be uniquely rearranged vibsane-type diterpenes by spectroscopic analyses and comparison of NMR data with those of previously reported vibsane-type diterpenes. In addition, irradiation of vibsanin B (12) in methanol with a high-pressure Hg lump led to the direct formation of neovibsanins A (14) and B (15). These results gave a clue to understanding of the biogenetic interconversion of 11-membered vibsanins into neovibsanins.
Cytotoxic iridoid aldehydes from Taiwanese Viburnum luzonicum.	Four new iridoid aldehydes bearing (E)- or (Z)-p-coumaroyl group, luzonial A (1), luzonial B (2), luzonidial A (3), and luzonidial B (4), were isolated from a methanol extract of the dried leaves of Viburnum luzonicum collected in Kaoshiung, Taiwan and their structures were elucidated by analysis of spectroscopic data. Compounds 1-3 exhibited moderate inhibitory activity against HeLa S3 cancer cells.
