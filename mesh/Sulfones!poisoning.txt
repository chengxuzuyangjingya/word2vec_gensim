Experimental research on the toxicity of the product orthochlorobenzene sulfur chloride]	The potential of toxic action in rats of orthochlorbenzol sulphochloride, administered intragastrically in single doses and in daily doses included in food, was estimated. Other bioenzymatic parameters of liver function (transaminase, gammaglutamyltransferase, glutamatdehydrogenase etc.), which presented changes in all experiments performed during this investigations, were also analyzed. Based on the obtained results, stop-gap suggestions of maximum admitted concentrations in environmental elements and air at the work places (0.5 mg/cubic meter) were made.
