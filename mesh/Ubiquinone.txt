NMR solution structure of the integral membrane enzyme DsbB: functional insights into DsbB-catalyzed disulfide bond formation.	We describe the NMR structure of DsbB, a polytopic helical membrane protein. DsbB, a bacterial cytoplasmic membrane protein, plays a key role in disulfide bond formation. It reoxidizes DsbA, the periplasmic protein disulfide oxidant, using the oxidizing power of membrane-embedded quinones. We determined the structure of an interloop disulfide bond form of DsbB, an intermediate in catalysis. Analysis of the structure and interactions with substrates DsbA and quinone reveals functionally relevant changes induced by these substrates. Analysis of the structure, dynamics measurements, and NMR chemical shifts around the interloop disulfide bond suggest how electron movement from DsbA to quinone through DsbB is regulated and facilitated. Our results demonstrate the extraordinary utility of NMR for functional characterization of polytopic integral membrane proteins and provide insights into the mechanism of DsbB catalysis.
Ubiquinone concentrations in athiorhodaceae grown under various environmental conditions.	1. The nature and concentration of ubiquinone in six species of Athiorhodaceae have been examined after growth under aerobic and photosynthetic conditions. 2. Increase in ubiquinone concentration during adaptive synthesis of photosynthetic pigments by Rhodopseudomonas spheroides incubated under low-aeration conditions was observed. 3. The nature of the carbon source was found to have a marked effect on ubiquinone, as well as bacteriochlorophyll, concentrations.
