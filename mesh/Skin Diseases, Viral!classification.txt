Dermatologic lesions in patients infected with the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)]	Human T-cell Lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) was the first human retrovirus described. Some time after its discovery a group of diseases were related to this virus, such as, adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL), HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and HTLV-1 associated uveitis (HAU). In the nineties, HTLV-1 was associated to a severe eczema of children, called infective dermatitis (ID). Since then, several other skin manifestations have been observed in HTLV-1-infected individuals, particularly in patients with ATLL or HAM/TSP. However, according to some reports, dermatologic lesions are also common in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. Besides ID, all other skin lesions reported are nonspecific. The aim of this review is to outline the dermatologic manifestations reported in HTLV-1 infected patients, emphasizing the clinical and epidemiological value of these findings.
