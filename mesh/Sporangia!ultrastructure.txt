Fermentation process improvement of a Chinese traditional food: soybean residue cake.	Fermentation process improvement of soybean residue cake, a Chinese traditional fermented food, and its physicochemical analysis during fermentation were studied. One of the dominant strains in the fermentation was isolated and identified as Mucor racemosus Fresenius. The fermentation process was improved by subsection fermentation. The crude protein content decreased from 19.95 ± 0.03% in the raw soybean residue to 16.85 ± 0.10% in the fermented products, and the formaldehyde nitrogen content increased from 0.068 ± 0.004% to 0.461 ± 0.022% in final fermented cakes. Hardness of samples significantly (P < 0.05) increased whereas springiness, cohesiveness, and resilience significantly (P < 0.05) decreased with increasing fermentation time, respectively. Microstructure observations showed obvious change of the surface of cake samples during the fermentation process.
Improved detection and identification of aquatic fungi and chitin in aquatic environments.	Chitin is a polymer of major importance in aquatic environments. We report on a new chitin-staining method for environmental samples. Major advantages of this method are (i) its high specificity and (ii) its suitability for combination with general stains, such as 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), or taxa-specific methods, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This method lets aquatic mycologists explore basal fungal lineages directly in situ, identify their hosts, occurrence and evolutionary traits.
