Functional evaluation in the rat sciatic nerve defect model: a comparison of the sciatic functional index, ankle angles, and isometric tetanic force.	The sciatic functional index has long been the standard method of assessing motor recovery in the rat sciatic nerve model. The relative subjective nature of the assessment has led to development of newer methods, including video gait analysis and quantitative measurement of isometric tetanic muscle force.
