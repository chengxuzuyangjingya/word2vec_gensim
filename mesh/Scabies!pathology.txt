Facial involvement in scabies in infancy]	The infestation of a 3-month-old child with Sarcoptes scabiei by way of infested nipples during the breast-feeding period led initially to facial papules and later to generalized dermatitis. Scabies mites were not detected on the face; studies on ten infested babies in India supported this findings. Thus, direct antiscabies treatment to the face is not necessary in babies.
