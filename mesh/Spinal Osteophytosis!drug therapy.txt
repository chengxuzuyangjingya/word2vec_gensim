The efficacy and safety of eperisone in patients with cervical spondylosis: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.	A randomized, double-blind, clinical trial was undertaken to assess the activity of eperisone hydrochloride (50 mg t.i.d.), a commonly used muscle relaxant, as a treatment for cervical spondylosis in 157 patients. The results showed a clear benefit of eperisone treatment with regard to pain in the nuchal region, back pain, pain in arms and shoulders, stiffness and other symptoms of cervical spondylosis, while the tolerability of the treatment was optimal.
