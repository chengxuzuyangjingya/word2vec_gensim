Making the purchase decision: factors other than price.	Taking price out of the limelight and concentrating on customer relations, mutual respect, and build-in/buy-in; involving the user; developing communication and evaluation processes; and being process oriented to attain the results needed require commitment on the part of administration and materiel management. There must be a commitment of time to develop the process, commitment of resources to work through the process, and a commitment of support to enhance the process. With those three parameters in place, price will no longer be the only factor in the purchasing decision.
Security in health service libraries--a survey in North West Thames Region.	My aim is to discuss the results of a survey of health service libraries in North West Thames Region undertaken in November 1990 as part of a more detailed study of library security. Widely varying patterns of losses were discovered. The ways in which librarians have tried to resolve these problems are described and a number of possible solutions are proposed. A brief review of the literature is also included.
