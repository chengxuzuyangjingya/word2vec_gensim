Prevalence of Rickettsia spp. in Dermacentor marginatus ticks removed from game pigs (Sus scrofa) in southern France.	During the months of October and November 2000 a total of 70 Dermacentor marginatus ticks were removed from different game pigs Sus scrofa in southern France and investigated by PCR using primers derived from the citrate synthase (gltA) and the outer membrane protein (OmpB) genes of rickettsiae. Based on sequence analysis of 1,150 bp fragment of gltA, Rickettsia slovaca was identified in 11 ticks (15.7%). These results confirm that Rickettsia slovaca, an emerging pathogen is highly prevalent in Dermacentor marginatus ticks in France. Moreover, a new Rickettsia genotype was detected in one specimen (1.4%). The pathogenic role of this new rickettsia has yet to be demonstrated.
Ixodes ricinus as a vector of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti in urban and suburban forests.	In the suburban and urban forests in the cities of Gdansk, Sopot and Gdynia (northern Poland), Ixodes ricinus ticks should be considered as the vector of pathogenic microorganisms that may cause significant diseases in wild and domestic animals and humans. These microorganisms include etiologic agents of Lyme disease, human anaplasmosis (HA) and babesiosis: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti, respectively. DNA extracts from 701 ticks collected in 15 localities were examined by PCR for the simultaneous detection of these 3 pathogens. Overall, 14 % were infected with A. phagocytophilum followed by 12.4 % with B. burgdorferi s.l. and 2.3 % with B. microti. In total, the percentage of infected females (32.9 %) was 2.4 times higher than in males (13.7 %) and 3.2 times higher than in nymphs (10.3 %). Among adult ticks (n = 303), 8.3 % were dually infected with A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi s.l., 2.0 % with the agent of human anaplasmosis and B. microti and 0.3 % with borreliae and B. microti.
