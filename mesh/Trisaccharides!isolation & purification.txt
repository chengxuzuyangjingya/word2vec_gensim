New galactosyllactose containing alpha-glycosidic linkage isolated from ovine (Booroola dorset) colostrum.	Three trisaccharides, tetra-, penta-, hexa- and certain higher oligosaccharides were obtained from ovine colostrum as free forms. The chemical structure of the three trisaccharides were determined by methylation and 13C-NMR analyses to be as follows: Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc, Gal beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc (3'-galactosyllactose) and Gal beta 1-6Gal beta 1-4Glc (6'-galactosyllactose). Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc, which had been confirmed as the oligosaccharide portion of a glycolipid prepared biosynthetically from rat spleen or bone marrow, has been identified for the first time from natural sources as a free form. The trisaccharide containing alpha-galactosyl unit is a novel compound in mammalian milk.
