Meigs' syndrome with elevated serum cancer antigen 125 levels in a case of ovarian sclerosing stromal tumor.	Meigs' syndrome presenting as an ovarian tumor with elevated serum cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) levels is unusual. Only 37 cases have been reported, including three cases of ovarian sclerosing stromal tumor (SCT). Many reports have suggested that the presence of ascites is the major factor inducing mesothelial expression of CA 125.
