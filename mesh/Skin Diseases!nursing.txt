A review of the impact and effectiveness of nurse-led care in dermatology.	To identify systematically, summarize and critically appraise the current evidence regarding the impact and effectiveness of nurse-led care in dermatology.
Benefits of a unit-based skin care group.	The medical patient population presents with various types of wounds when admitted to the hospital. A clinical nurse specialist (CNS) is often consulted to help nurses to assess wounds and dress them appropriately. Because CNS consultation is available only during business hours, staff identified a need for a core group of nurses to be knowledgeable about wound care. To address this need, a skin group was developed and given additional education. The members of this group were able to provide several interventions geared toward the nursing staff. In conjunction with the unit-based CNS, the skin group members have helped to improve the skin and wound care that patients receive and have consistently delivered this care in a timely manner.
