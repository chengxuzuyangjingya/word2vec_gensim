Viridans streptococci bacteremia in children with malignancy: relevance of species identification and penicillin susceptibility.	Our aim was to determine the significance of species identification and penicillin susceptibility of viridans streptococci in children with malignancies. Streptococcus mitis accounted for 58% of invasive viridans streptococcal infections of which 51% were penicillin-nonsusceptible. There was no significant association between species or penicillin susceptibility pattern and clinical presentation or outcome.
Prevalence rate and antibiotic susceptibility of oral viridans group streptococci (VGS) in healthy children population.	The aim of this study was to evaluated the prevalence rate of oral viridans group streptococci (VGS) and their susceptibilities to some antibiotics in healthy children.
