The generation of phospholipase A and hemolytic fatty acids by autolysing suspensions of Trypanosoma congolense.	When T. congolense undergoes autolysis there is a concomitant appearance of phospholipase A activity and hemolytic fatty acids. The generation of enzyme activity is exponential, and the appearance of hemolytic activity corresponds to a free fatty acid concentration of 0.02 to 0.03 mg. per ml. The concentration of the trypanosome suspension markedly affected the kinetics of the generation process. In contrast, the autolysis of T. lewisi did not generate hemolytic activity unless exogenous phospholipase A was added to the organisms.
