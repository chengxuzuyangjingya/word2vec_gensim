Oral health promotion in the schools: a historical analysis and case study.	This article discusses the historical shifts between the treatment-oriented, instructional and primary preventive approaches to oral health promotion, especially in school-based programs in New Zealand and Australia. While in the past much effort has been put into treatment-oriented and instructional programs, their impact has been limited. Among those primary preventive activities that have demonstrated clear benefits are various types of fluoridation and adhesive sealants for the occlusal surfaces of teeth. Further emphasis on primary prevention over treatment is needed to better insure the success of school-based oral health promotion programs. In addition, more effort needs to be put into policy direction, linkages within the educational system, planning, and evaluation.
