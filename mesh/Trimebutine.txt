Colonic radiography by double-contrast enema in the elderly patient with the use of trimebutine maleate]	About 15% of hospitalizations of patients over 65 are due to disorders of the colon which means that accurate analysis of history and clinical and instrumental investigation are mandatory. Our attention has been focused on x-ray examination using a double-contrast enema which, together with endoscopy, permits to diagnose colonic disorders with significant reliability. Our aim was to adapt the method to the special needs of the patient over 65 by employing the active substance trimebutine maleate (M.T.) as a "contact" pressure-lowering agent. Thirty-five subjects aged 65-75 with pathologies implying a risk for the use of parasympatholytic agents were examined. None of these patients showed side effects. It can therefore be said that the use of M.T. as a hypotonic agent in double-contrast enemas is an indisputable diagnostic aid.
