Evaluation of cochlear implant electrode position after a modified round window insertion by means of a 64-multislice CT.	The modified round window insertion enables reproducible insertion into the scala tympani as demonstrated by comparing the 64-CT scanning data and the surgeon's reports.
Scalar localization by computed tomography of cochlear implant electrode carriers designed for deep insertion.	This study aimed to evaluate the possibility of predicting radiologically the scalar localization of a 31.5-mm-long, free-fitting electrode carrier for cochlear implantation, using conventional planar computed tomography.
