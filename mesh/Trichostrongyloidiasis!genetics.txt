Genomic tools to improve parasite resistance.	The natural genetic variability of the ruminant immune system provides a feasible means to control gastrointestinal (GI) parasite infection without anthelmintics. However, the paradigm of traditional selection has not been effectively applied to the moderately heritable traits of parasite resistance (h approximately equal to 0.3) due to the difficulty and expense of gathering accurate phenotypes in a commercial production setting. These characteristics make host traits related to GI nematode infection ideal candidates for genomics-based research. To initiate explanation of important allelic differences, economic trait loci (ETL) are being identified and mapped using a resource population of Angus cattle segregating for GI nematode resistance and susceptibility to the two most common nematode parasites of US cattle, Ostertagia ostertagi and Cooperia oncophora. The population is composed of five generations of half-sib progeny with complete phenotypic records produced from controlled infections. To detect the genomic locations of the three distinct phenotypic traits being expressed (innately immune, acquired immune, and immunologically non-responsive), genotypes have been generated for DNA markers (N=199) spaced at regular intervals (approximately 20cm intervals) throughout the entire genome (3000cm). Although initial ETL detection may be limited by half-sib family size, the unique structure of this population provides additional statistical power for refining map position of potential ETL. After allele frequency and contribution to phenotype are determined in this population, marker tests associated with ETL most beneficial for controlling parasite infection can be accurately used for selection. Comparative map and functional genomic information from humans and other species of biomedical importance will be utilized in further investigations to elucidate the genes underlying ETL.
