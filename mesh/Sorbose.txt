PRODUCTION OF PROTOPLASTS IN AN OSMOTIC MUTANT OF NEUROSPORA CRASSA WITHOUT ADDED ENZYME.	Hamilton, James G. (Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, La.), and Janet Calvet. Production of protoplasts in an osmotic mutant of Neurospora crassa without added enzyme. J. Bacteriol. 88:1084-1086. 1964.-An osmotic mutant of Neurospora crassa was grown in minimal medium containing increasing concentrations of sorbose. Protoplasts were produced in the higher concentrations by inhibition of cell-wall synthesis. Similar molar concentrations of fructose, glucose, and sucrose also produced protoplasts, suggesting a relationship between inhibition of cell-wall synthesis and osmotic pressure. Increased sugar concentration led to decreased growth.
