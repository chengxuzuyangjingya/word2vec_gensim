Live Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis activate the inflammatory response through Toll-like receptors 2, 4, and 9 in species-specific patterns.	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that recognize molecular structures on pathogens and activate host defenses. Although much is known about specific bacterial components that activate TLRs, few studies have addressed the question of which TLRs are involved in immune activation by live bacteria. Here, we demonstrate that live Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis, the three principal causes of bacterial meningitis, use distinct sets of TLRs to trigger the inflammatory response. Using human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines, each overexpressing one type of TLR, we found that S. pneumoniae triggered activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB and expression of interleukin-8, only in cells expressing TLR2 or -9. The same response was evoked by H. influenzae in cells expressing TLR2 or -4 and by N. meningitidis in cells expressing TLR2, -4, or -9. It is interesting that the ability of S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis to activate TLR9 was severely attenuated when bacteria had been heat-inactivated prior to stimulation of the cells. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we blocked TLR2, -4, or -9 and confirmed the essential role of these TLRs and also identified differential functions of TLRs in activation of the inflammatory response. Collectively, we here demonstrate that S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and N. meningitidis each activate several TLRs in species-specific patterns and show that infection with live pathogens may lead to activation of PRR not targeted by inactivated bacteria.
Candida-host cell receptor-ligand interactions.	The interaction of Candida species with their cognate host receptors is a key factor in the pathogenesis of different types of candidiasis. The recognition of different forms of Candida albicans by Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 on mononuclear leukocytes has recently been discovered to determine the function and activity of regulatory T-cells, determine the balance of Type 1 and Type 2 cytokines and, thereby, influence the antifungal activity of both the innate and adaptive immune response. Different forms of C. albicans are also recognized by different lectins that are expressed on the surface macrophages. C. albicans and Candida glabrata express the ALS (agglutinin-like sequence) and EPA (epithelial adhesin) families of adhesins, respectively. A key difference between C. glabrata and C. albicans is that EPA expression in C. glabrata is governed by sub-telomeric silencing, whereas ALS expression in C. albicans is regulated by other mechanisms.
Induction of dendritic cell maturation by pertussis toxin and its B subunit differentially initiate Toll-like receptor 4-dependent signal transduction pathways.	Pertussis toxin (PT) has the capacity to activate dendritic cells (DCs) for the augmentation of cell-mediated immune responses. To investigate the mechanism(s) by which PT activates DCs, we investigated the effects of PT and its B-oligomer (PTB) on the maturation of human and mouse DCs and determined whether PT could act as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern to activate one of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs).
TLR4-NOX4-AP-1 signaling mediates lipopolysaccharide-induced CXCR6 expression in human aortic smooth muscle cells.	CXCL16 is a transmembrane non-ELR CXC chemokine that signals via CXCR6 to induce aortic smooth muscle cell (ASMC) proliferation. While bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been shown to stimulate CXCL16 expression in SMC, its effects on CXCR6 are not known. Here, we demonstrate that LPS upregulates CXCR6 mRNA, protein, and surface expression in human ASMC. Inhibition of TLR4 with neutralizing antibodies or specific siRNA interference blocked LPS-mediated CXCR6 expression. LPS stimulated both AP-1 (c-Fos, c-Jun) and NF-kappaB (p50 and p65) activation, but only inhibition of AP-1 attenuated LPS-induced CXCR6 expression. Using dominant negative expression vectors and siRNA interference, we demonstrate that LPS induces AP-1 activation via MyD88, TRAF6, ERK1/2, and JNK signaling pathways. Furthermore, the flavoprotein inhibitor diphenyleniodonium chloride significantly attenuated LPS-mediated AP-1-dependent CXCR6 expression, as did inhibition of NOX4 NADPH oxidase by siRNA. Finally, CXCR6 knockdown inhibited CXCL16-induced ASMC proliferation. These results demonstrate that LPS-TLR4-NOX4-AP-1 signaling can induce CXCR6 expression in ASMC, and suggest that the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis may be an important proinflammatory pathway in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
TLR7/8 agonists impair monocyte-derived dendritic cell differentiation and maturation.	Pathogen recognition by TLR activates the innate immune response and is typically followed by the development of an adaptive immune response initiated by antigen presentation. Dendritic cells (DC) are the most efficient APC and express diverse TLRs, including TLR7 and -8, which have been recently identified as targets for ssRNA recognition during viral infection. We have studied the effect of TLR7/8 agonists on DC differentiation and maturation from human monocytes. The synthetic agonist Resiquimod (R-848) or the physiological agonist ssRNA impaired monocyte differentiation to DC phenotypically and functionally. Induced expression of the nonclassical MHC molecules of the CD1 family in DC was inhibited at the protein and mRNA levels, and antigen acquisition was inhibited. Proinflammatory cytokine (including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta) and IL-10 production were induced during DC differentiation. Cross-talk between TLR4 and TLR7/8 was revealed as immature DC, which had been differentiated in the presence of R-848 were insensitive to LPS-mediated maturation and cytokine production but still induced allostimulation. These data lead us to suggest that ongoing viral activation of TLR7/8 could alter the adaptive immune response by modifying DC differentiation and by down-regulating DC responsiveness to a subsequent bacterial TLR4-mediated signal.
Ethanol intake enhances inflammatory mediators in brain: role of glial cells and TLR4/IL-1RI receptors.	The brain is one of the major target organs of ethanol actions, and its chronic and acute intoxication results in significant alterations in brain structure and function, and in some cases to neurodegeneration. Glial cells and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are vital players in CNS immune response; dysregulation of this response plays an important role in brain damage and neurodegeneration. Ethanol has immunomodulatory effects and induces specific alterations in the TLRs response in many tissues. These actions depend on the cell type, ethanol dose and treatment duration, as well as the concomitant presence of pathogens and their characteristics. Recent findings indicate that low concentrations of ethanol (10 mM) promote inflammatory processes in brain and in glial cells by up-regulating cytokines and inflammatory mediators (iNOS, NO, COX-2), and by activating signaling pathways (IKK, MAPKs) and transcriptional factors (NF-kappaB, AP-1) implicated in inflammatory injury. TLR4/IL-1RI receptors may be involved in ethanol-mediated inflammatory signaling, since blocking these receptors abolishes the production of ethanol-induced inflammatory mediators and cell death. We propose that at low physiologically relevant concentrations, ethanol facilitates TLR4/IL-1RI recruitment into lipid rafts microdomains, leading to the activation and signaling of these receptors. In summary, current results suggest that TLR4/ IL-1RI are important targets of ethanol-induced inflammatory brain damage.
Serpin A1 and CD91 as host instruments against HIV-1 infection: are extracellular antiviral peptides acting as intracellular messengers?	Serpin A1 (alpha1-antitrypsin, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor) has been shown to be a non-cytolytic antiviral factor present in blood and effective against HIV infection. The best known physiological role of serpin A1 is to inhibit neutrophil elastase, a proteinase which is secreted by neutrophils at sites of infection and inflammation. Decreased HIV-infectivity is associated with decreased density of membrane-associated elastase. The enzyme may facilitate binding of the HIV membrane protein gp120 to host cells, and it specifically cleaves SDF-1, the physiological ligand of the HIV-1 co-receptor CXCR4. It has been suggested that one of the actions of serpin A1 as antiviral agent is to reduce HIV infectivity, and this property could be due to elastase inhibition. However, the most dramatic effect of serpin A1 is inhibition of HIV production. In vitro experiments indicate that the C-terminal peptide of serpin A1, produced during the formation of the complex of serpin with serine proteinases, may be responsible for the inhibition of HIV-1 expression in infected cells. This peptide, an integral part of the serpin-enzyme complex, is internalized by several scavenger receptors. Peptides corresponding to the C-terminal section of serpin A1 inhibit HIV-1 long-terminal-repeat-driven transcription and interact with nuclear proteins, such as alpha1-fetoprotein transcription factor. LDL-receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1/CD91), the best known receptor for serpin-enzyme complexes, is up-regulated in monocytes of HIV-1-infected true non-progressors. CD91 could be one of the major players in host resistance against HIV-1. It has the capacity of internalizing antiviral peptides such as serpin C-terminal fragments and alpha-defensins, and is at the same time the receptor for heat-shock proteins in antigen-presenting cells, in which chaperoned viral peptides could lead to the induction of cytotoxic T-cell responses.
Simple method for repurification of endotoxins for biological use.	A method for obtaining highly purified endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) in a few hours by repurification of commercial or laboratory preparations was devised. It avoids the use of phenol, which is not suitable for phenol-soluble lipopolysaccharides nor for some industrial purposes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the integrity of the purified LPSs. The purified products did not activate Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), nuclear oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1), or NOD2 but did activate TLR4. Applied to different lipopolysaccharides, the method also improved their mass spectra, thus facilitating their structural analysis.
Apoptotic cells inhibit LPS-induced cytokine and chemokine production and IFN responses in macrophages.	Apoptosis is a critical process in tissue homeostasis and results in immediate removal of the dying cell by professional phagocytes such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells actively suppresses production of proinflammatory growth factors and cytokines. Impaired phagocytosis of apoptotic cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In this study we found that, in addition to suppressing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of TNF-alpha and IL-6, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages suppressed production of the chemokine CXCL10 that is activated by LPS-induced autocrine-acting type I IFNs. Inhibition of cytokine and chemokine production was not universally affected because LPS-induced production of IL-10 and IL-8 was not significantly affected. Apoptotic cells had minimal effects on LPS-induced activation of NF-kappaB and MAPKs, but induced expression of SOCS proteins and substantially suppressed induction of CXCL10 expression by IFN-alpha. In addition to suppressing LPS responses, apoptotic cells inhibited macrophage responses to another major macrophage activator IFN-gamma by attenuating IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 activation and downstream gene expression. These results identify suppressive effects of apoptotic cells on signal transduction, and extend our understanding of the anti-inflammatory effects of apoptotic cells to include suppression of Jak-STAT signaling.
Endogenous danger signals trigger hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury through toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-kappa B pathway.	Restoration of blood flow to the ischemic liver lobes may paradoxically exacerbate tissue injury, which is called hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), expressed on several liver cell types, and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway are crucial to mediating hepatic inflammatory response. Because IRI is essentially a kind of profound acute inflammatory reaction evoked by many kinds of danger signals, we investigated TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway activation in a murine model of partial hepatic IRI.
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway exerts protective effects during sepsis by controlling C5a-mediated activation of innate immune functions.	The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway has been recently suggested to have controversial functions in models of acute and chronic inflammation. Our group and others have reported previously that the complement split product C5a alters neutrophil innate immunity and cell signaling during the onset of sepsis and is involved in PI3K activation. We report in this study that in vivo inhibition of the PI3K pathway resulted in increased mortality in septic mice accompanied by strongly elevated serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-10 during sepsis as well as decreased oxidative burst activity in blood phagocytes. PI3K inhibition in vitro resulted in significant increases in TLR-4-mediated generation of various proinflammatory cytokines in neutrophils, whereas the opposite effect was observed in PBMC. Oxidative burst and phagocytosis activity was significantly attenuated in both neutrophils and monocytes when PI3K activation was blocked. In addition, PI3K inhibition resulted in strongly elevated TLR-4-mediated generation of IL-1beta and IL-8 in neutrophils when these cells were co-stimulated with C5a. C5a-induced priming effects on neutrophil and monocyte oxidative burst activity as well as C5a-induced phagocytosis in neutrophils were strongly reduced when PI3K activation was blocked. Our data suggest that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway controls various C5a-mediated effects on neutrophil and monocyte innate immunity and exerts an overall protective effect during experimental sepsis.
Cell proliferation and survival induced by Toll-like receptors is antagonized by type I IFNs.	TRIF is an adaptor protein associated with the signaling by Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 and TLR4 for the induction of type I IFNs. Here, we demonstrate a mechanism by which TLR signaling controls cell proliferation and survival. We show that TLR3 and TLR4 can induce cell cycle entry via TRIF, which targets the cell cycle inhibitor p27(kip1) for relocalization, phosphorylation by cyclin/cdk complexes, and proteasome degradation. These events are antagonized by type I IFN induced by the TRIF pathway. Furthermore, in human dendritic cells treated with TLR3, TLR4, or TLR5 ligands, we demonstrate that IFN signaling modulates p27(kip1) degradation and apoptosis, identifying an immunoregulatory "switching" function of type I IFNs. These findings reveal a previously uncharacterized function of TLR signaling in cell proliferation and survival.
Hemorrhagic shock induces NAD(P)H oxidase activation in neutrophils: role of HMGB1-TLR4 signaling.	Hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation (HS/R)-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays an important role in posthemorrhage inflammation and tissue injury. We have recently reported that HS/R-activated neutrophils (PMN), through release of ROS, serve an important signaling function in mediating alveolar macrophage priming and lung inflammation. PMN NAD(P)H oxidase has been thought to be an important source of ROS following HS/R. TLR4 sits at the interface of microbial and sterile inflammation by mediating responses to both bacterial endotoxin and multiple endogenous ligands, including high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). Recent studies have implicated HMGB1 as an early mediator of inflammation after HS/R and organ ischemia/reperfusion. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that HS/R activates NAD(P)H oxidase in PMN through HMGB1/TLR4 signaling. We demonstrated that HS/R induced PMN NAD(P)H oxidase activation, in the form of phosphorylation of p47phox subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase, in wild-type mice; this induction was significantly diminished in TLR4-mutant C3H/HeJ mice. HMGB1 levels in lungs, liver, and serum were increased as early as 2 h after HS/R. Neutralizing Ab to HMGB1 prevented HS/R-induced phosphorylation of p47phox in PMN. In addition, in vitro stimulation of PMN with recombinant HMGB1 caused TLR4-dependent activation of NAD(P)H oxidase as well as increased ROS production through both MyD88-IRAK4-p38 MAPK and MyD88-IRAK4-Akt signaling pathways. Thus, PMN NAD(P)H oxidase activation, induced by HS/R and as mediated by HMGB1/TLR4 signaling, is an important mechanism responsible for PMN-mediated inflammation and organ injury after hemorrhage.
Bakery flour dust exposure causes non-allergic inflammation and enhances allergic airway inflammation in mice.	Baker's asthma is one of the most commonly reported occupational lung diseases in countries where fresh bread is baked daily in large quantities, and is characterized by rhinitis, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and reversible airflow obstruction. Epidemiological studies have identified pre-existing atopy as an important risk factor for developing baker's asthma, yet the aetiology and pathogenesis of baker's asthma remain poorly understood.
TLR4 signaling induces B7-H1 expression through MAPK pathways in bladder cancer cells.	TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) and B7-H1, which were known to be restricted to immune cells in the past, were found to be aberrantly expressed in a majority of tumor cells, facilitating tumor evasion from immune surveillance. Our study demonstrated that activation of TLR4 signaling in bladder cancer cells up-regulated B7-H1 expression. Furthermore, this regulation was significantly attenuated by ERK or JNK inhibitor. Our results elucidated the molecule mechanism of regulation of B7-H1 expression through TLR4 signaling and may suggest new strategies of down-regulating the cancer-associated B7-H1 expression for bladder cancer treatment.
Lipopolysaccharide activates NF-kappaB by TLR4-Bcl10-dependent and independent pathways in colonic epithelial cells.	In colonic epithelium, one of the pathways of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation of NF-kappaB and IL-8 is via Toll-like receptor (TLR)4, MyD88, IRAK1/4, and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (Bcl10). However, this innate immune pathway accounts for only approximately 50% of the NF-kappaB activation, so additional mechanisms to explain the LPS-induced effects are required. In this report, we identify a second pathway of LPS-induced stimulation, mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), in human colonic epithelial tissue cells in tissue culture and in ex vivo mouse colonic tissue. Measurements of IL-8, KC, Bcl10, phospho-IkappaBalpha, nuclear NF-kappaB, and phosphorylated Hsp27 were performed by ELISA. The TLR4-Bcl10 pathway was inhibited by Bcl10 siRNA and in studies with colonic tissue from the TLR4-deficient mouse. The ROS pathway was inhibited by Tempol, a free radical scavenger, or by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of Hsp27 dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The ROS pathway was unaffected in the TLR4-deficient tissue or by silencing of Bcl10. The combination of exposure to the free radical scavenger Tempol and of TLR4 or Bcl10 suppression was required to completely inhibit the LPS-induced activation. The ROS pathway was associated with dephosphorylation of Hsp27. LPS appears to activate both the regulatory component of the IkappaBalpha-kinase (IKK) signalosome through Bcl10 interaction with Nemo (IKKgamma) and the catalytic component through Hsp27 interaction with IKKbeta. Since LPS exposure is associated with septic shock and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, distinguishing between these two pathways of LPS activation may facilitate new approaches to prevention and treatment.
Macrophages, inflammation, and insulin resistance.	Obesity induces an insulin-resistant state in adipose tissue, liver, and muscle and is a strong risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance in the setting of obesity results from a combination of altered functions of insulin target cells and the accumulation of macrophages that secrete proinflammatory mediators. At the molecular level, insulin resistance is promoted by a transition in macrophage polarization from an alternative M2 activation state maintained by STAT6 and PPARs to a classical M1 activation state driven by NF-kappaB, AP1, and other signal-dependent transcription factors that play crucial roles in innate immunity. Strategies focused on inhibiting the inflammation/insulin resistance axis that otherwise preserve essential innate immune functions may hold promise for therapeutic intervention.
LPS promotes pre-osteoclast activity by up-regulating CXCR4 via TLR-4.	Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been shown to be a prominent pathogenic factor in inflammatory bone loss. However, knowledge of the mechanisms involved is limited. The role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 (Stromal-derived factor-1 and its unique chemokine receptor) axis in LPS-induced bone loss has not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in LPS-stimulated inflammatory bone loss. The results show that LPS does not influence the expression of SDF-1/CXCR4 in osteoblasts, but up-regulates the expression of CXCR4 in pre-osteoclasts via Toll-like receptor 4, which subsequently enhances pre-osteoclast migration. Moreover, LPS promoted RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation partially through CXCR4 up-regulation. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated, for the first time, that the up-regulated expression of CXCR4 in pre-osteoclasts by LPS stimulation is involved in LPS-induced bone resorption.
Toll-like receptor 4-dependent adjuvant activity of Kakkon-to extract exists in the high molecular weight polysaccharide fraction.	Kakkon-to, a traditional herbal medicine (Kampo formula), has been used historically in China and Japan for the treatment of infectious diseases such as influenza and the common cold. However, the biological mechanism of its therapeutic action has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the immunological function of Kakkon-to and found that the high molecular weight fraction of the extract activated macrophages in vitro. This fraction was found to be composed primarily of saccharides and in vitro intensively stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages that produce Th1 inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFalpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The fraction did not activate macrophages from C3H/HeJ lacking Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) or MyD88-deficient mice, indicating that macrophage activation by the fraction was mediated by TLR4. The route of administration of the fraction into mice regulated the kinetics of TNFalpha production in immune organs. Intravenous administration induced TNFalpha production in the four target organs of spleen, liver, lung, and Peyers patch; however, the most abundant production occurred in the liver and peaked at 30-60 min post administration. Peritoneal administration induced similar kinetics but the most abundant production occurred in the spleen. In contrast, oral administration induced TNFalpha production in the liver, lung, and Peyers patch, but not in the spleen. Although liver and lung are TNFalpha-abundant organs, production peaks in these organs occurred later than in Peyers patch. We also found that the fraction induced antibody production as an adjuvant against a specific antigen ovalbumin (OVA) when administered simultaneously and subcutaneously in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the fraction induced IgG-class antibody in response to low doses of the antigen, which induced only IgM-class antibody when administered alone, suggesting that the fraction induces a class switch of immunoglobulin as an adjuvant in vivo. The high molecular weight fraction of Kakkon-to extract could be applicable as a potent immunostimulating drug and adjuvant.
Toll-like receptor 4 and myeloid differentiation factor 88 provide mechanistic insights into the cause and effects of interleukin-6 activation in mouse liver regeneration.	Partial hepatectomy (PH) consistently results in an early increase of circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is thought to play a major role in liver regeneration. Activation of this cytokine after PH requires the adaptor protein, MyD88, but the specific MyD88-related receptors involved remain unidentified. It is also unknown whether the magnitude of IL-6 elevation determines the extent of subsequent hepatocyte proliferation. Here, we uncovered artifacts in the assessment of circulating IL-6 levels when using cardiac puncture in mice after PH. By using retro-orbital bleed sampling, we show that the circulating levels of IL-6 after PH were not directly correlated with the extent of hepatocyte DNA synthesis in individual mice. The IL-6 increase after PH was attenuated in all lipopolysaccharide-hyporesponsive mouse strains studied (e.g., C3H/HeJ, Tlr4 null, Cd14 null, Tlr2,4,9 null, and Tlr2,4-Caspase1 null) and was severely abrogated in Myd88 null mice. Despite attenuated IL-6 levels, Tlr4 null mice showed normal signaling downstream of IL-6 and normal hepatocyte proliferation. In contrast, Myd88 null mice showed severe impairments in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation and Socs3 induction, but had enhanced and prolonged extracellular signal-related kinase 1 and 2 phosphorylation in the first 6 hours after PH. Unexpectedly, these changes were associated with accelerated initiation of hepatocyte proliferation, as assessed by hepatocyte bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, phospho-histone H3 immunostaining, and cyclin E and A protein expression.
High-mobility group box 1 activates caspase-1 and promotes hepatocellular carcinoma invasiveness and metastases.	Hypoxia is often found in solid tumors and is associated with tumor progression and poor clinical outcomes. The exact mechanisms related to hypoxia-induced invasion and metastasis remain unclear. We elucidated the mechanism by which the nuclear-damage-associated molecular pattern molecule, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), released under hypoxic stress, can induce an inflammatory response to promote invasion and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Caspase-1 activation was found to occur in hypoxic HCC cells in a process that was dependent on the extracellular release of HMGB1 and subsequent activation of both Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)- and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE)-signaling pathways. Downstream from hypoxia-induced caspase-1 activation, cleavage and release of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and -18 occurred. We further demonstrate that overexpression of HMGB1 or treatment with recombinant HMGB1 enhanced the invasiveness of HCC cells, whereas stable knockdown of HMGB1 remarkably reduced HCC invasion. Moreover, in a murine model of HCC pulmonary metastasis, stable knockdown of HMGB1 suppressed HCC invasion and metastasis.
Peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide synergistically enhance bone resorption and osteoclastogenesis.	Peptidoglycan (PGN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are bacterial cell wall constituents that are able to induce bone resorption by stimulating Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4, respectively. The fragments of PGN also stimulate inflammatory responses via nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 1 and NOD2, although there are differences in the NOD-stimulatory activities between gram-positive and gram-negative PGNs. The TLR and NOD signaling pathways are known to engage in cross-talk to enhance the production of inflammatory cytokines. In the present study, we investigated the effects of gram-negative and gram-positive PGNs on bone resorption and osteoclastogenesis in the presence or absence of LPS.
Eps8 protein facilitates phagocytosis by increasing TLR4-MyD88 protein interaction in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages.	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial in macrophage phagocytosis, which is pivotal in host innate immune response. However, the detailed mechanism is not fully defined. Here, we demonstrated that the induction of Src and Eps8 in LPS-treated macrophages was TLR4- and MyD88-dependent, and their attenuation reduced LPS-promoted phagocytosis. Confocal microscopy indicated the colocalization of Eps8 and TLR4 in the cytosol and at the phagosome. Consistently, both Eps8 and TLR4 were present in the same immunocomplex regardless of LPS stimulation. Inhibition of this complex formation by eps8 siRNA or overexpression of pleckstrin homology domain-truncated Eps8 (i.e. 261-p97(Eps8)) decreased LPS-induced TLR4-MyD88 interaction and the following activation of Src, focal adhesion kinase, and p38 MAPK. Importantly, attenuation of Eps8 impaired the bacterium-killing ability of macrophages. Thus, Eps8 is a key regulator of the LPS-stimulated TLR4-MyD88 interaction and contributes to macrophage phagocytosis.
The sterile immune response during hepatic ischemia/reperfusion.	Hepatic ischemia and reperfusion elicits an immune response that lacks a microbial constituent yet poses a potentially lethal threat to the host. In this sterile setting, the immune system is alarmed by endogenous danger signals that are release by stressed and dying liver cells. The detection of these immunogenic messengers by sentinel leukocyte populations constitutes the proximal trigger for a self-perpetuating cycle of inflammation, in which consecutive waves of cytokines and chemokines orchestrate the influx of various leukocyte subsets that ultimately confer tissue destruction. This review focuses on the temporal organization of sterile hepatic inflammation, using surgery-induced trauma as a template disease state.
Novel role for the innate immune receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and photoreceptor apoptosis.	Recent evidence has implicated innate immunity in regulating neuronal survival in the brain during stroke and other neurodegenerations. Photoreceptors are specialized light-detecting neurons in the retina that are essential for vision. In this study, we investigated the role of the innate immunity receptor TLR4 in photoreceptors. TLR4 activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly reduced the survival of cultured mouse photoreceptors exposed to oxidative stress. With respect to mechanism, TLR4 suppressed Wnt signaling, decreased phosphorylation and activation of the Wnt receptor LRP6, and blocked the protective effect of the Wnt3a ligand. Paradoxically, TLR4 activation prior to oxidative injury protected photoreceptors, in a phenomenon known as preconditioning. Expression of TNFα and its receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2 decreased during preconditioning, and preconditioning was mimicked by TNFα antagonists, but was independent of Wnt signaling. Therefore, TLR4 is a novel regulator of photoreceptor survival that acts through the Wnt and TNFα pathways.
Oleic acid induces lung injury in mice through activation of the ERK pathway.	Oleic acid (OA) can induce acute lung injury in experimental models. In the present work, we used intratracheal OA injection to show augmented oedema formation, cell migration and activation, lipid mediator, and cytokine productions in the bronchoalveolar fluids of Swiss Webster mice. We also demonstrated that OA-induced pulmonary injury is dependent on ERK1/2 activation, since U0126, an inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, blocked neutrophil migration, oedema, and lipid body formation as well as IL-6, but not IL-1β production. Using a mice strain carrying a null mutation for the TLR4 receptor, we proved that increased inflammatory parameters after OA challenges were not due to the activation of the TLR4 receptor. With OA being a Na/K-ATPase inhibitor, we suggest the possible involvement of this enzyme as an OA target triggering lung inflammation.
Disparate roles of marrow- and parenchymal cell-derived TLR4 signaling in murine LPS-induced systemic inflammation.	Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) occurs in a range of infectious and non-infectious disease processes. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) initiate such responses. We have shown that parenchymal cell TLR4 activation drives LPS-induced systemic inflammation; SIRS does not develop in mice lacking TLR4 expression on parenchymal cells. The parenchymal cell types whose TLR4 activation directs this process have not been identified. Employing a bone marrow transplant model to compartmentalize TLR4 signaling, we characterized blood neutrophil and cytokine responses, NF-κB1 activation, and Tnf-α, Il6, and Ccl2 induction in several organs (spleen, aorta, liver, lung) near the time of LPS-induced symptom onset. Aorta, liver, and lung gene responses corresponded with both LPS-induced symptom onset patterns and plasma cytokine/chemokine levels. Parenchymal cells in aorta, liver, and lung bearing TLR4 responded to LPS with chemokine generation and were associated with increased plasma chemokine levels. We propose that parenchymal cells direct SIRS in response to LPS.
IRAK4 kinase activity is not required for induction of endotoxin tolerance but contributes to TLR2-mediated tolerance.	Prior exposure to LPS induces "endotoxin tolerance" that reprograms TLR4 responses to subsequent LPS challenge by altering expression of inflammatory mediators. Endotoxin tolerance is thought to limit the excessive cytokine storm and prevent tissue damage during sepsis but renders the host immunocompromised and susceptible to secondary infections. Tolerance initiated via one TLR can affect cellular responses to challenge via the same TLR ("homotolerance") or through different TLRs ("heterotolerance"). IRAK4, an essential component of the MyD88-dependent pathway, functions as a kinase and an adapter, activating subsets of divergent signaling pathways. In this study, we addressed mechanistically the role of IRAK4 kinase activity in TLR4- and TLR2-induced tolerance using macrophages from WT versus IRAK4(KDKI) mice. Whereas IRAK4 kinase deficiency decreased LPS signaling, it did not prevent endotoxin tolerance, as endotoxin pretreatment of WT and IRAK4(KDKI) macrophages inhibited LPS-induced MAPK phosphorylation, degradation of IκB-α and recruitment of p65 to the TNF-α promoter, expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased levels of A20 and IRAK-M. Pretreatment of WT macrophages with Pam3Cys, a TLR2-TLR1 agonist, ablated p-p38 and p-JNK in response to challenge with Pam3Cys and LPS, whereas IRAK4(KDKI) macrophages exhibited attenuated TLR2-elicited homo- and heterotolerance at the level of MAPK activation. Thus, IRAK4 kinase activity is not required for the induction of endotoxin tolerance but contributes significantly to TLR2-elicited homo- and heterotolerance. 
Differential regulation of TLR-dependent MyD88 and TRIF signaling pathways by free zinc ions.	Zinc signals are utilized by several immune cell receptors. One is TLR4, which causes an increase of free zinc ions (Zn(2+)) that is required for the MyD88-dependent expression of inflammatory cytokines. This study investigates the role of Zn(2+) on Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-β (TRIF)-dependent signals, the other major intracellular pathway activated by TLR4. Chelation of Zn(2+) with the membrane-permeable chelator N,N,N',N'-Tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine augmented TLR4-mediated production of IFN-β and subsequent synthesis of inducible NO synthase and production of NO. The effect is based on Zn(2+) acting as a negative regulator of the TRIF pathway via reducing IFN regulatory factor 3 activation. This was also observed with TLR3, the only TLR that signals exclusively via TRIF, but not MyD88, and does not trigger a zinc signal. In contrast, IFN-γ-induced NO production was unaffected by N,N,N',N'-Tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine. Taken together, Zn(2+) is specifically involved in TLR signaling, where it differentially regulates MyD88 and TRIF signaling via a zinc signal or via basal Zn(2+) levels, respectively. 
Origin and pharmacological modulation of tumor-associated regulatory dendritic cells.	Protumorigenic activity of immune regulatory cells has been proven to play a major role in precluding immunosurveillance and limiting the efficacy of anticancer therapies. Although several approaches have been offered to deplete myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells, there are no data on how to control suppressive dendritic cell (DC) accumulation or function in the tumor environment. Although immunosuppressive function of DC in cancer was implicated to immature and plasmacytoid DC, details of how conventional DC (cDC) develop immunosuppressive properties remain less understood. Here, we show that the development of lung cancer in mice was associated with fast accumulation of regulatory DC (regDC) prior to the appearance of MDSC. Using the in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrated that (i)both cDC and MDSC could be polarized into protumor regDC in the lung cancer environment; (ii) cDC → regDC polarization was mediated by the small Rho GTPase signaling, which could be controlled by noncytotoxic doses of paclitaxel; and (iii) prevention of regDC appearance increased the antitumor potential of DC vaccine in lung cancer. These findings not only bring new players to the family of myeloid regulatory cells and provide new targets for cancer therapy, but offer novel insights into the immunomodulatory capacity of chemotherapeutic agents used in low, noncytotoxic doses.
Toll-like receptor 4-mediated ROS signaling pathway involved in Ganoderma atrum polysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-α secretion during macrophage activation.	Ganoderma atrum has been used as Chinese traditional medicine and healthful mushroom for thousands of years. The polysaccharide is regarded as the major bioactive substances in G. atrum. To delineate the underlying mechanism and signaling cascade involved in the immunomodulatory property of G. atrum polysaccharide (PSG-1). Specifically, this study is designed to examine the possibility of TLR4 as a candidate receptor interacted with G. atrum polysaccharide (PSG-1) and elucidate the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PSG-1-induced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production during macrophage activation. Flow cytometric and confocal laser-scanning microscopy analysis showed that fluorescence-labeled PSG-1 bind specifically to the macrophages. Moreover, PSG-1 stimulated TNF-α secretion of peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeN mice, but not from C3H/HeJ mice. PSG-1-indcued TNF-α production was suppressed by anti-TLR4 mAb. Furthermore, ROS production was mediated by TLR4, and NADPH oxidase-derived ROS act as upstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K)/Akt/mitogen-activated protein kinases(MAPKs)/nuclear factor(NF)-κB signaling pathway in the regulation of PSG-1 stimulated TNF-α production. Taken together, we conclude that PSG-1 induces TNF-α secretion through TLR4/ROS/PI3K/Akt/MAPKs/NF-κB pathways during macrophage activation. Our findings provide a molecular basis for the potential of PSG-1 as a novel immunomodulatory agent. 
Toll-like receptor 4 promotes control of Leishmania infantum infection through inducement of leishmanicidal activity in host macrophages: role of mitogen activated kinases.	Establishment of Leishmania infection inside macrophages requires deactivation of various signaling pathways that are dispensable for effective immune responses against the parasite. In the present study, we provide evidence that Leishmania infantum promastigotes attachment on the surface of peritoneal macrophages, internalization and transformation to amastigotes abrogated the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) 1/2, p38 mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK) and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and TNFalpha. Subsequent macrophage stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during the first hours of exposure to parasite or infection resulted in restoration of MAPK phosphorylation. However, LPS-mediated MAPK activation required parasite internalization (uptake) since cytochalasin-D pretreated macrophages did not responded to LPS stimulation. IL-12, TNFalpha, and NO production was positively regulated with MAPK phosphorylation in contrast to nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) which was MAPK independent. Specifically, inhibition of MAPK activation with specific inhibitors revealed that IL-12 production required p38 MAPK activation, whereas TNFalpha and NO production required all three MAPK. The restoration of NO production resulted in decrease of infection rates. Hence, these results suggest that in contrast to phagocytosis of L. infantum promastigotes, establishment of infection does not desensitize macrophages to subsequent stimulation with LPS, resulting in parasite elimination through MAPK and NF-&#954;B activation and partial restoration of IL-12, TNFalpha and NO synthesis. 
Toll-like receptor 4 mediates inflammatory cytokine secretion in smooth muscle cells induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein.	Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-regulated secretion of inflammatory cytokines in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is regarded as an important step in the progression of atherosclerosis; however, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study investigated the role of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in oxLDL-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines in SMCs both in vivo and in vitro. We found that the levels of TLR4, interleukin 1-β (IL1-β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression were increased in the SMCs of atherosclerotic plaques in patients with femoral artery stenosis. In cultured primary arterial SMCs from wild type mice, oxLDL caused dose- and time-dependent increase in the expression levels of TLR4 and cytokines. These effects were significantly weakened in arterial SMCs derived from TLR4 knockout mice (TLR4-/-). Moreover, the secretion of inflammatory cytokines was blocked by TLR4-specific antibodies in primary SMCs. Ox-LDL induced activation of p38 and NFκB was also inhibited in TLR4-/- primary SMCs or when treated with TLR4-specific antibodies. These results demonstrated that TLR4 is a crucial mediator in oxLDL-induced inflammatory cytokine expression and secretion, and p38 and NFκB activation.
