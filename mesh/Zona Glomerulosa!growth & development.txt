Effects of prolonged cysteamine administration on the rat adrenal cortex: evidence that endogenous somatostatin is involved in the control of the growth and steroidogenic capacity of zona glomerulosa.	A week daily administration of cysteamine (CYS, 300 mg kg-1) lowered plasma aldosterone concentration in rats, without affecting PRA, kalaemia and the plasma levels of ACTH and corticosterone. Prolonged CYS treatment caused a notable hypertrophy of adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG) and its parenchymal cells, without inducing any apparent change in zona fasciculata morphology. Isolated ZG cells from CYS-treated rats evidenced a notable enhancement in their basal and maximally-stimulated productions of aldosterone and corticosterone. All these effects of chronic CYS administration were completely reversed by the simultaneous infusion of rats with somatostatin (SRIF, 12 micrograms kg-1 h-1). CYS exposure was not found to directly affect the secretory activity of isolated ZG cells from normal rats. Since CYS is known to be a specific depletor of SRIF in different organs of rats, these findings suggest that endogenous SRIF may be involved in the modulation of ZG function.
