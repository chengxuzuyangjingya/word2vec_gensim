Cellular sources of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 up-regulation in the spinal dorsal horn after spinal nerve ligation.	Recent studies suggested that the development of neuropathic pain associated with neural injury may be partly due to up-regulation of cyclooxygenase (COX) in the central nervous system. However, the cellular sources of COX-1 and COX-2 up-regulation following nerve injury are unclear.
Changes in expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in the spinal dorsal horn after intrathecal p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 on neuropathic pain in rats]	To investigate the changes of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the spinal cord dorsal horn after intrathecal a specific p38MAPK inhibitor-SB203580 on neuropathic pain in rats induced by chronic constrictive injury (CCI) to the sciatic nerve.
