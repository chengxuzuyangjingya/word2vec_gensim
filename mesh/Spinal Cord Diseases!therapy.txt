Attitudes and practices regarding influenza vaccination among healthcare workers providing services to individuals with spinal cord injuries and disorders.	To examine influenza vaccination status and predictors for vaccine receipt among healthcare workers (HCWs) caring for patients with spinal cord injuries and disorders.
Application of SCS for movement disorders and spasticity.	20 patients with movement disorders and spasticity were treated with SCS to decrease tonus and improve impaired motor function. 12 patients with multiple sclerosis had gait disorders and slight up to considerable increase in tonus. We observed quantitative changes in diminution of spasticity, voluntary motor function, bladder function, lessening of ataxia and pain relief. During a follow-up of up to 4 years no deterioration in the patients' condition could be observed. 11 patients reported a more fluent gait in 6 cases accompanied by a decrease in tonus. Increase in tonus and deterioration of gait pattern were observed after break down of the stimulation. Although the indications for electrostimulation still remains uncertain in some cases with definite diagnosis without any progressive character of the disease and without severe neurological disturbances improvement can be obtained.
