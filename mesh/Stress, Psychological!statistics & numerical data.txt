Occupational stress and job satisfaction among flight nurses. A survey of National Flight Nurses Association members.	A mail survey of members of the National Flight Nurses Association was conducted to assess occupational stress and job satisfaction. In addition to scales measuring stress and job satisfaction, the questionnaire requested demographic information and included a depression scale. The anticipated direct relationship between stress and depression was observed (r = .56, p .0001), as were the expected inverse relationships between stress and job satisfaction (r = .54, p less than .0001), and between depression and job satisfaction (r = -.45, p .0001). Responses to statements on the stress scale indicated that work interference with family life and failure to receive recognition were important sources of stress, while avoidance behaviors such as tardiness and daydreaming were used infrequently to cope with stress. Inadequate recognition, particularly by administrators and supervisors, and lack of involvement in decision-making processes surfaced as sources of dissatisfaction, as did inadequate feedback about job performance. The tasks performed by flight nurses and being members of cohesive work groups were important sources of job satisfaction. The results indicate that although flight nurses basically are satisfied with their jobs and enjoy working in air medical transport, they want to know that they are performing well. They also want to be involved in decision-making processes and to be recognized for the stressful jobs they perform.
