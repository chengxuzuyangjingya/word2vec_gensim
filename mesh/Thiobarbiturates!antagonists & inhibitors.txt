Inhibition of lipid peroxidation by prostaglandin oligomeric derivatives.	The inhibition of lipid peroxidation by oligomeric derivatives synthesized from prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and PGB2 was studied using two rat models. In an in vitro model, the brain was exposed to decapitation-ischemia, the cortex was removed and homogenized, and the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBAR) was measured after exposing the homogenate to in vitro reoxygenation either in the presence or absence of oligomers. It was found that these oligomers could inhibit lipid peroxidation, and that their activities were higher than that of superoxide dismutase (SOD). In an in vivo administration model, either the oligomer or the vehicle was injected i.p. 30 min before decapitation. The brain was exposed to decapitation-ischemia, the cortex was homogenized and exposed to 'in vitro' reoxygenation, after which TBAR value was determined. Ester-type compounds had a greater activity than free-acid type compounds in inhibiting lipid peroxidation. A possible mechanism of the protective effect of these oligomers in ischemia/reperfusion injury may be to scavenge oxygen free radicals.
