Coagulase-negative Staphylococci isolated from patients. III. Phage typing]	Coagulase-negative staphylococci of clinical origin were subjected to phage typing by means of phages from the experimental Dutch (Verhoef) and American (Paris) sets. These sets of phages were used to study 153 and 378 strains, respectively. The Dutch phages could lyse 30.1%, and the American ones 19.6% of the cultures. The strains belonging to the species S. epidermidis were lysed in 34.3% and 32.4% of cases, respectively, which is indicative of the fact that the American phages possess a more pronounced specificity in respect to S. epidermidis. The unsufficient effectiveness of typing phages does not yet allow one to evaluate the outlook for the method of phage typing in the study of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
