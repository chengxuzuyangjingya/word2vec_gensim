Clock genes and body composition in patients with schizophrenia under treatment with antipsychotic drugs.	In the healthy population, several pathways are known to exert an effect on basal metabolic factors. Previous studies have found associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms in clock genes or downstream hormone receptors such as the leptin receptor (LEPR) or glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and obesity in the healthy population, but this association remains to be examined in patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics.
Loss of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β/ζ (RPTPβ/ζ) promotes prostate cancer metastasis.	The role of pleiotrophin and its receptors RPTPβ/ζ and Syndecan-3 during tumor metastasis remains unknown.
