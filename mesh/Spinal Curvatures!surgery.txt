Revision deformity surgery.	Revision deformity surgery may be necessary for several reasons. Symptomatic pseudarthrosis, implant failure or pull-out, or loss of correction may mandate reoperation. The keys to a successful revision procedure are a careful analysis of the problem, particularly the mode of failure and the contributing biomechanical factors, and the development of an appropriate surgical plan.
