History of medicine. Alphonse Loewenthal (1903-1983)--the uncrowned king of dermatology in Africa.	The career and achievements of Dr L. J. A. Loewenthal, M.D., F.R.C.P., as a dermatologist in Africa are sketched. He made notable contributions to local dermatology. Starting in 1931 in Uganda with studies on tropical ulcer and vitamin A deficiency, he ended his career in Johannesburg 40 years later with investigations on the skin of miners. Over this period it is doubtful whether any dermatologist on the African continent equalled his accomplishments.
