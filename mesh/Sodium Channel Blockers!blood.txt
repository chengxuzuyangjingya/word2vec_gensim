Translation of flecainide- and mexiletine-induced cardiac sodium channel inhibition and ventricular conduction slowing from nonclinical models to clinical.	Nonclinical in vivo models used for cardiovascular safety testing have not previously been studied for their sensitivity for detection of conduction slowing resulting from cardiac sodium channel block. The goal of this study was to examine the sensitivity of in vivo models to cardiac sodium channel block, and translation of the effect from in vitro to in vivo models using sodium channel inhibitors flecainide and mexiletine; flecainide, but not mexiletine is commonly associated with QRS complex prolongation in humans.
